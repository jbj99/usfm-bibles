\q
\v 1 O Shepherd of Israel, hear us,
\q2 who leadest Joseph like a flock!
\q Shine from thy throne above the kherubs,
\q2
\v 2 for Ephraim and Manasseh!
\q Oh stir thy strength
\q2 and come to our rescue!
\q3
\v 3 O God of hosts, restore us to power;
\q3 a smile of thy favour, and we are saved!
\b
\q
\v 4 O Lord of hosts, how long will thine anger fume,
\q2 though thy people are praying?
\q
\v 5 Thou hast made tears our daily bread,
\q2 and tears on tears our drink;
\q
\v 6 thou has made us the butt of our neighbours,
\q2 the jest of our foes.
\q3
\v 7 O God of hosts, restore us to power;
\q3 a smile of thy favour, and we are saved!
\b
\q
\v 8 Thou didst bring a vine from Egypt,
\q2 thou didst plant her, driving out the nations;
\q
\v 9 when thou didst clear a place for her,
\q2 she took root and she spread over the land,
\q
\v 10 till her shadow lay over the mountains,
\q2 and her boughs covered even the mighty cedars;
\q
\v 11 she pushed her tendrils to the sea,
\q2 her shoots to the Euphrates.
\q
\v 12 Why hast thou torn her fences down,
\q2 till passers-by all strip her,
\q
\v 13 till the boar from the forest gnaws her,
\q2 and wild beasts graze on her?
\q
\v 14 O God of hosts, we pray thee,
\q2 look once again from heaven, look on her;
\q
\v 15 take this vine, thy charge, replant her,
\q2 this the vine thy right hand planted.
\q
\v 16 Men have burned her, cut her down–
\q2 may they perish at thy frown!
\q
\v 17 Do thou protect thy chosen folk,
\q2 those thou hast nurtured for thyself;
\q
\v 18 then shall we never be faithless to thee;
\q2 revive us, and we will worship thee.
\q3
\v 19 O God of hosts, restore us to power;
\q3 a smile of thy favour, and we are saved!

\q
\v 1 Sing aloud to God our strength,
\q2 shout for joy to Jacob’s God;
\q
\v 2 raise the chorus, sound the drum,
\q2 sound the sweet lyre and the lute,
\q
\v 3 at the new moon blow the trumpet,
\q2 and at full moon, for our festival.
\q
\v 4 This is laid down for Israel,
\q2 a rule of Jacob’s God;
\q
\v 5 he made it a law in Joseph, 
\q2 on leaving Egypt’s land.
\b
\q I heard one whom I knew not, saying:
\q
\v 6 “I freed your shoulder from the load,
\q2 your hands from the heavy hod;
\q
\v 7 at your cry of distress I rescued you,
\q2 I answered you from thunder-clouds,
\q2 I tested you at the waters of Merîbah.
\q
\v 8 Listen, my people, to my warning–
\q2 O Israel, if you would only listen:
\q
\v 9 you must allow no foreign god,
\q2 no worship of an outside god;
\q
\v 10 I am your God, I the Eternal,
\q2 who brought you out of Egypt’s land;
\q2 open your mouth and I will fill it.
\b
\q
\v 11 But my people would not listen,
\q2 Israel would have none of me;
\q
\v 12 so I left them to their own self-will,
\q2 to follow their own devices.
\q
\v 13 Oh that my people would listen to me,
\q2 that Israel would live my life!
\q
\v 14 I would soon subdue their foes,
\q2 and strike at their oppressors;
\q
\v 15 those who hate them would cower before them,
\q2 in unending terror;
\q
\v 16 and I would feed them with the finest wheat,
\q2 with honey from the rock to their hearts’ content.”

\q
\v 1 God stands out in the council of the gods,
\q2 among the gods he rules supreme.
\q
\v 2 “How long will you rule unjustly,
\q2 favouring evil men?
\q
\v 3 Uphold the weak, the fatherless,
\q2 let the forlorn and poor have justice;
\q
\v 4 rescue the weak and wretched,
\q2 from the grip of evil men.
\q
\v 6 Or, I say, though you are gods,
\q2 all sons of the Most High,
\q
\v 7 yet, like mere men, you shall die,
\q2 you shall perish like a demon.”
\b
\q
\v 8 Up, O God, rule thou the earth,
\q2 the true Lord of all pagans–
\q
\v 5 senseless and ignorant, they blindly move,
\q2 till the world shakes to its core!

\c 83
\d An Asaphite song, for music.
\q
\v 1 Keep not still, O God,
\q2 speak, stir, O God!
\q
\v 2 Here are thy foes in uproar,
\q2 thine enemies are alert,
\q
\v 3 plotting against thy folk cunningly,
\q2 conspiring against thy precious people,
\q
\v 4 saying, “Come, let us blot them out of being,
\q2 ill Israel be no more a nation.”
\q
\v 5 So they plan, with one consent,
\q2 in a league against thee–
\q
\v 6 Edomites and Ishmaelites,
\q2 Moabites and Hagrites,
\q
\v 7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amâlek,
\q2 the Philistines and Tyre,
\q
\v 8 Samaria a confederate,
\q2 allied to the sons of Lot.
\q
\v 9 Treat them like Sisera and Jabin
\q2 at the torrent of the Kishon,
\q
\v 10 who perished at Endor,
\q2 dropping like dung.
\q
\v 11 Treat their chiefs like Oreb and Zeêb,
\q2 their lords like Zeba and Zalmunna,
\q
\v 12 for thinking they could seize and hold
\q2 the fields of God!
\q
\v 13 My God, whirl them away like dust,
\q2 like straw before the wind;
\q
\v 14 as fire burns up the forest,
\q2 as flames set hills ablaze,
\q
\v 15 so drive them as thou stormiest,
\q2 and scare them in thy rage;
\q
\v 16 bring them to blank dishonour,
\q2 till they turn to thee, O Eternal!
\q
\v 17 Theirs be defeat and dismay unending,
\q2 disgrace and destruction!–
\q
\v 18 to teach them that thou, O Eternal, thou
\q2 art the Most High God over all the world.

\q
\v 1 How dear thy dwelling is,
\q2 O Lord of hosts!
\q
\v 2 My soul has been panting and pining
\q2 for the courts of the Eternal;
\q now soul and body thrill with joy
\q2 over the living God,
\q
\v 3b over thine own altars,
\q2 O Lord of hosts, my King and God;
\q
\v 3a the bird has found her home at last,
\q2 a nest to lay her young!
\b
\q
\v 4 Happy are they who live within thy house,
\q2 praising thee all day long!
\q
\v 5 Happy are they who, nerved by thee,
\q2 set out on pilgrimage!
\q
\v 6 When they pass through Weary-glen,
\q2 fountains flow for their refreshing,
\q2 blessings rain upon them;
\q
\v 7 they are the stronger as they go,
\q2 till God at last reveals himself in Sion.
\b
\q
\v 8 Hear my prayer, O Lord of hosts,
\q2 O God of Jacob, listen;
\q
\v 9 God, our protector, look on us,
\q2 welcome thy chosen to thy presence.
\q
\v 10 Better a single day within thy courts
\q2 than a thousand days outside!
\q I would rather sit at the threshold of God’s house
\q2 than live inside the tents of worldly men.
\q
\v 11 For God the Eternal is a sun and shield,
\q2 favour and honour he bestows;
\q2 he never denies bliss to the upright.
\q
\v 12 O Lord of hosts,
\q2 happy the man who trusts in thee!

\d From the Choirmaster’s collection. A Korahite song.
\q
\v 1 Once thou didst favour thy land, O Eternal,
\q2 restoring the fortunes of Jacob,
\q
\v 2 pardoning thy people’s guilt,
\q2 forgiving all their sins,
\q
\v 3 recalling all thy wrath,
\q2 averting thy hot anger.
\b
\q
\v 4 Deliver us again, O God our saviour,
\q2 and break off thy displeasure.
\q
\v 5 Wilt thou be always angry with us?
\q2 Wilt thou prolong thy wrath, age after age?
\q
\v 6 Wilt thou not again revive us,
\q2 that thy people may rejoice in thee?
\q
\v 7 Let us enjoy thy kindness, O Eternal,
\q2 grant us thy saving aid.
\b
\q
\v 8 Let me listen to God speaking,
\q2 speaking surely words of peace
\q to his people, to devout men,
\q2 whose hearts turn to himself;
\q
\v 9 soon shall his worshippers see his aid,
\q2 till his great Presence dwells within our land.
\b
\q
\v 10 Kindness and faithfulness unite,
\q2 victory and peace embrace,
\q
\v 11 faithfulness rising from the earth,
\q2 and kindness looking down from heaven,
\q
\v 13 victory marching before God,
\q2 peace following in his footsteps.

\q
\v 1 Bend thine ear to me, O thou Eternal, answer me,
\q2 for I am weak and wretched;
\q
\v 2 Oh save my life, for I am true to thee,
\q2 rescue thy servant who relies on thee.
\q
\v 3 Thou art my God, be gracious, O Eternal,
\q2 for all day long I cry to thee;
\q
\v 4 gladden the soul of thy servant,
\q2 for on thee, O Lord, I set my heart.
\q
\v 5 Lord, thou art kind and ready to forgive,
\q2 rich in thy love to all who call on thee.
\q
\v 6 O thou Eternal, listen to my prayer,
\q2 and hear my pleading cry;
\q
\v 7 I call upon thee in my hour of need,
\q2 for thou wilt answer me.
\q
\v 8 There is no god like thee, O Lord,
\q2 there are no deeds like thine;
\q
\v 9 all nations thou hast made shall come
\q2 and bow down before thee,
\q2 glorifying thee, O Lord,
\q
\v 10 for thou art great, thou workest wonders,
\q2 thou, only thou, art God.
\b
\q
\v 11 Teach me what is thy way, O thou Eternal,
\q2 how to live loyal to thee;
\q2 may reverence for thee rejoice my heart.
\q
\v 12 With all my heart I thank thee, O my God,
\q2 for ever will I glorify thee;
\q
\v 13 for thou hast a great love to me, O Lord,
\q2 saving me from the very depths of death.
\q
\v 14 Proud creatures are assailing me, O God,
\q2 a gang of ruthless men would murder me,
\q2 men who care nothing for thee.
\q
\v 15 But thou art a God pitiful and gracious,
\q2 slow to be angry, rich in love and loyalty;
\q2
\v 16 turn and have pity upon me, O Lord,
\q grant thy strength to thy servant,
\q2 help thy retainer;
\q
\v 17 let me have some sign of thy favour,
\q2 a sight of thine own aid and consolation,
\q2 to the dismay of those who hate me.

\d A Korahite song, for music.
\q
\v 1 The Eternal founded her upon the sacred hills;
\q
\v 2 aye, Sion and her gates are more to him
\q than any dwelling in the land.
\q
\v 3 Dear city of God, he utters thy glories:
\q
\v 4 “Egypt and Babylon, Philistia, Tyre
\q2 I count as mine
\q2 for there this follower and that was born;
\q
\v 5 but Sion! – her name shall be Mother,
\q for every follower of mine belongs to her by birth.”
\q
\v 6 The Eternal writes of every nation, in his census,
\q “This follower of mine was born in it”;
\q but, prince or people, everyone has his home in thee, O Sion.

\d A Korahite song for music from the Choirmaster’s collection. To the tune of “Suffering sore.” An ode of Heman the Ezrahite.
\q
\v 1 O thou Eternal, I cry for help in the daytime,
\q2 and at night I moan before thee;
\q
\v 2 let my prayer reach thy presence,
\q2 bend an ear to my cry.
\q
\v 3 For trouble fills my soul to the full,
\q2 my life is on the verge of death;
\q
\v 4 I am already reckoned among the departed,
\q2 I am but the shadow of a man,
\q
\v 5 left to myself among the dead,
\q2 like the slain lying in their graves,
\q of whom thou hast mind no more–
\q2 they are deprived of thee.
\q
\v 6 In the nethermost pit thou hast placed me,
\q2 in abysses dark and deep;
\q
\v 7 thy wrath lies heavy upon me,
\q2 thy waves all overwhelm me.
\q
\v 8 Thou has removed my friends from afar,
\q2 and made them loathe me;
\q I cannot get free from my prison,
\q2
\v 9 and my health pines away under my trouble.
\b
\q Daily I call to thee, O thou Eternal,
\q2 I stretch my hands to thee. 
\q
\v 10 Canst thou work wonders for the dead?
\q2 Can ghosts arise to praise thee?
\q
\v 11 Can thy love be recounted in the grave,
\q2 thy faithfulness within the world below?
\q
\v 12 Can thy wonders be known in the darkness,
\q2 thy saving help in the land of oblivion?
\q
\v 13 I am crying for help, O Eternal, to thee,
\q2 my prayer comes to thee in the morning.
\q
\v 14 Why discard me, O Eternal?
\q2 Why hide thy face from me?
\q
\v 15 Ever since youth I have suffered and languished,
\q2 crushed by the dread of thee, I faint;
\q
\v 16 thy burning wrath sweeps over me,
\q2 thy terrors have undone me,
\q
\v 17 surging round me without end,
\q2 closing round on every side.
\q
\v 18 Thou has put far every friend,
\q2 and darkness is my one companion.

\c 89
\d An ode of Ethan the Ezrahite.
\q
\v 1 I will sing always of the Eternal’s love,
\q2 telling all ages of thy faithfulness;
\q
\v 2 for thy love thou hast promised to be lasting,
\q2 thy faithfulness is firmly fixed in heaven,
\q
\v 5 and heaven is praising, O Eternal, heaven’s own host,
\q2 the marvel of thy faithfulness.
\q
\v 6 For who above can rank with the Eternal,
\q2 what angel can compare with the Eternal?–
\q
\v 7 a God to be dreaded at the heavenly council,
\q2 an over-awing God.
\q
\v 8 O thou Eternal, God of hosts, who can compare with thee,
\q2 in all thy love and faithfulness?
\q
\v 9 Thy sway is over the proud sea;
\q2 when the waves toss, thou stillest them.
\q
\v 10 Rahab thou didst cut and crush to pieces,
\q2 scattering thy foes by the force of thine arm.
\q
\v 11 The heavens are thine, the earth is thine,
\q ’twas thou didst found the world and all it holds;
\q
\v 12 the north and south, thou madest them,
\q2 Tabor and Hermon hills acclaim thee.
\q
\v 13 Thine is a right powerful arm,
\q2 a strong hand, a right hand swung high;
\q
\v 14 thy throne rests upon equity and justice,
\q2 Love and Faithfulness are thine attendants.
\b
\q
\v 15 Happy the people who know thy festal songs,
\q2 who live in the sunshine of thy favour!
\q
\v 16 All day long they exult, O thou Eternal,
\q2 and extol thy equity.
\q
\v 17 For thou art our pride, thou our strength,
\q2 and, thanks to thy favour, our honour is high;
\q
\v 18 we are defended by the Eternal,
\q2 by our King, the Majestic One of Israel.
\b
\q
\v 3 Thou saidst, “I make a compact with my chosen,
\q2 I swear to my servant David,
\q
\v 4 to make his dynasty endure,
\q2 to make his throne last for all time”:
\q
\v 19 thou didst tell thy trusted seer,
\q2 thy voice came in a vision:
\q “I have crowned a hero,
\q2 chosen a youth from the people,
\q
\v 20 I have picked out my servant David
\q2 and consecrated him as king.
\q
\v 21 My hand shall always help him,
\q2 my arm shall make him strong:
\q
\v 22 no foe shall ever surprise him,
\q2 no miscreants shall master him;
\q
\v 23 I will shatter his enemies before him,
\q2 and strike down all who hated him;
\q
\v 24 my loyalty and love shall be with him,
\q2 and I will lift him high in honour;
\q
\v 25 I will extend his power to the sea,
\q2 and his authority far as the Euphrates;
\q
\v 26 he shall say, ‘Thou art my Father,
\q2 my God, my saving strength!’
\q
\v 27 And I will make him my first-born son,
\q2 highest of all kings on earth.
\q
\v 28 I will always keep my word to him,
\q2 my compact with him is secure;
\q
\v 29 I make his dynasty eternal,
\q2 his throne unending as the heavens.
\q
\v 30 If his sons forsake my law,
\q2 and follow not my orders,
\q
\v 31 if they break my rules,
\q2 and obey not my commands,
\q
\v 32 then I will scourge them for their sin
\q2 and lash them for their lawlessness,
\q
\v 33 but I will never take my love from him,
\q2 never will I belie my loyalty;
\q
\v 34 my compact I will never break,
\q2 my spoken word I will not change.
\q
\v 35 Once and for all I took a solemn oath,
\q2 and I will keep my word to David,
\q
\v 36 that for all time his dynasty should last,
\q2 his throne endure before me like the sun,
\q
\v 37 fixed as the moon for evermore,
\q2 firm as the constant sky.”
\b
\q
\v 38 And yet thou hast scorned, discarded,
\q2 stormed against thy chosen!
\q
\v 39 Thou hast abjured the compact with thy servant,
\q2 and thrown his sacred crown into the dust;
\q
\v 40 thou hast demolished all his walls
\q2 and laid his forts in ruin;
\q
\v 41 the passers-by all plunder him,
\q2 and he is the butt of his neighbours.
\q
\v 42 Thou has allowed his enemies to triumph,
\q2 giving delight to all his foes;
\q
\v 43 thou hast made him retreat before them,
\q2 and hast not upheld him in battle.
\q
\v 44 Thou hast removed his splendid sceptre
\q2 and dashed his throne to the ground;
\q
\v 45 thou has shortened the days of his youth
\q2 and heaped disgrace on him.
\q
\v 46 How long, O thou Eternal, wilt thou hide?
\q2 Shall thy wrath, like a fire, burn on for ever?
\q
\v 47 Remember, Lord, what life is!–
\q2 how frail and futile thou has made all men!
\q
\v 48 Who can live on and die not,
\q2 who can escape the grave?
\q
\v 49 Where is thy former love, O Lord,
\q2 which thou didst pledge to David faithfully?
\q
\v 50 Remember, Lord, the taunts thrown at thy servants,
\q2 the insults of the world we have to bear,
\q
\v 51 the taunts of thine own enemies, O Eternal,
\q2 taunting thy chosen at every step.

\d A prayer of Moses the man of God.
\q
\v 1 Age after age, Lord, thou has been our home;
\q2 from all eternity thou hast been God,
\q
\v 2 ere ever hills were born,
\q2 ere ever earth and world were made.
\q
\v 3 Thou crumblest man away,
\q2 summoning men back to the dust,
\q
\v 4 thou to whom a thousand years
\q2 are like the flight of yesterday,
\q2 like an hour passing in the night.
\q
\v 5 Year after year thou sowest men
\q2 like grass that grows anew,
\q
\v 6 that in the dawn is fresh and flourishing,
\q2 and by the twilight fades and withers.
\q
\v 7 For under thine anger we perish,
\q2 we sink in terror at thy wrath;
\q
\v 8 thou dost expose our sins
\q2 and layest our guilty secrets bare;
\q
\v 9 our days droop under thy displeasure,
\q2 our life is over like a sigh.
\q
\v 10 Our life is seventy years at most,
\q2 or eighty at the best;
\q it is a span of toil and trouble,
\q2 soon over, and we flit away.
\q
\v 11 Yet who weighs the full weight of thy displeasure?
\q2 Which of us dreads thine anger?
\q
\v 12 Oh teach us so to count our days,
\q2 that we may take it to heart.
\b
\q
\v 13 Relent, O thou Eternal, and delay not, 
\q2 be sorry for thy servants.
\q
\v 14 Let thy love dawn on us undimmed,
\q2 that all our life we may be glad and sing;
\q
\v 15 grant joy as long as thou hast been afflicting us,
\q2 for all the years that we have suffered;
\q
\v 16 let thy servants see thee at thy saving work,
\q2 and let their children see thy glorious power.
\q
\v 17 Lord, may thy loving favour rest on us,
\q2 and prosper all the work we undertake.

\c 91
\q
\v 1 Happy the man who stays by the Most High in shelter,
\q who lives under the shadow of Almighty God,
\q
\v 2 who calls the Eternal “My refuge and my fortress,
\q my God in whom I trust”!
\q
\v 3 He saves you from the fowler’s snare
\q and from the deadly pit;
\q
\v 4 he protects you with his pinions
\q and hides you underneath his wings.
\q
\v 5 You need not fear the terrors of the night,
\q nor arrows flying in the day;
\q
\v 6 you need not fear the plague that stalks in the dark,
\q nor sudden death at noon;
\q
\v 7 hundreds may fall beside you,
\q thousands at your right hand,
\q but the plague will never reach you,
\q
\v 4c safe shielded by his faithfulness.
\q
\v 8 You only have to look on and see
\q how evil men are punished;
\q
\v 9 but you have sheltered beside the Eternal,
\q and made the Most High God your home,
\q
\v 10 so no scathe can befall you,
\q no plague can approach your tent.
\q
\v 11 For he puts you in charge of his angels,
\q to guard you wherever you go,
\q
\v 12 to lift you in their hands
\q lest you trip over a stone;
\q
\v 13 you can walk over reptiles and cobras,
\q and trample on lions and dragons.

\d A song for the sabbath. To be accompanied. 
\q
\v 1 It is a joy to give thanks to the Eternal,
\q2 to sing thy praise, O thou Most High,
\q
\v 2 to proclaim thy goodness in the morning
\q2 and thy faithfulness at night,
\q
\v 3 to the sound of a ten-stringed lute,
\q2 to the sweet music of the lyre;
\q
\v 4 thy doings have made me glad, O thou Eternal,
\q2 I sing for joy at all that thou hast done.
\b
\q
\v 5 How great are thy deeds, O Eternal,
\q2 how deep are thy designs!
\q
\v 6 The dull man does not see,
\q2 the senseless does not understand,
\q
\v 7 that when bad men thrive like grass,
\q2 and evildoers flourish,
\q it is only to be rooted up for ever,
\q2
\v 8 while thou art supreme ever, O Eternal.
\b
\q
\v 9 Yonder are thy foes, O thou Eternal,
\q2 yonder are thy foes, destroyed!–
\q2 all evildoers scattered!
\q
\v 10 But thou dost raise me high to honour,
\q2 thou dost revive my failing strength;
\q
\v 11 I feast mine eyes on my defeated foes,
\q2 I hear with joy my enemies’ doom.
\b
\q
\v 12 But good men flourish like a palm,
\q2 and grow like cedars on Lebânon;
\q
\v 13 planted inside the Eternal’s precincts,
\q2 they flourish in the courts of our God,
\q
\v 14 still bearing fruit when they are old,
\q2 still fresh and green–
\q
\v 15 showing how just the Eternal is,
\q2 my Strength who never errs.

\c 93

\q2 thou art from all eternity.
\q
\v 3 The floods may storm, O thou Eternal,
\q2 the floods may storm aloud,
\q2 the floods may storm and thunder;
\q
\v 4 but high above the roaring billows,
\q2 high above the ocean breakers,
\q2 the Eternal stands supreme.
\q
\v 5 Thine own authority will never fail,
\q2 thy house will never lose its sanctity,
\q2 O thou Eternal One.

\c 94
\q
\v 1 O thou Eternal, thou avenging God, 
\q2 O thou avenging God, appear;
\q
\v 2 rise up, O Ruler of the world,
\q2 and let the haughty have what they deserve!
\q
\v 3 How long is it to last, O thou Eternal,
\q2 this exultation of ungodly men,
\q
\v 4 blustering insolently,
\q2 lording it arrogantly?
\q
\v 5 They crush thy people, O Eternal,
\q2 thy heritage they are harrying,
\q
\v 6 killing the widow and the foreigner
\q2 and murdering the fatherless;
\q
\v 7 and they think the Eternal never sees them,
\q2 Jacob’s God will never heed them!
\b
\q
\v 8 But mark this, dullest of the dull–
\q2 when will you understand, O senseless men?–
\q
\v 9 is he deaf, he who made the ear?
\q2 Is he blind, he who formed the eye?
\q
\v 10 Can he not punish men, he who is training them?
\q2 Has he no knowledge, he who teaches men?
\q
\v 11 Knowledge! The Eternal knows that human plans
\q2 are but an empty breath!
\b
\q
\v 12 Happy is he who has thy discipline
\q2 and thine instruction, training him
\q
\v 13 calmly to wait on, in adversity,
\q2 till a pit is dug for ungodly men!
\q
\v 14 For the Eternal will not leave his people,
\q2 will not forsake his own;
\q
\v 15 no, goodness shall have justice done to it–
\q2 the future is with men of upright mind.
\b
\q
\v 16 Who is my champion against the ungodly?
\q2 Who sides with me against the evildoers?
\q
\v 17 If the Eternal had not been my help,
\q2 I would have soon passed to the silent land.
\q
\v 18 When I think my foot is slipping,
\q2 thy goodness, O Eternal, holds me up;
\q
\v 19 when doubts crowd into my mind,
\q2 thy comforts cheer me.
\b
\q
\v 20 Can evil rulers have thee for an ally,
\q2 who work us injury by law,
\q
\v 21 who attack honest men,
\q2 and doom the innocent to death?
\q
\v 22 No, the Eternal who is my protection,
\q2 my God who is my strength, my safety–
\q
\v 23 may he requite them for their crime,
\q2 and for their evil make an end of them!

\c 95
\q
\v 1 Oh come, let us sing to the Eternal,
\q2 let us sing loudly to our saving Strength,
\q
\v 2 let us come before him with thanksgiving,
\q2 shouting to him songs of praise!
\q
\v 3 For a great God is the Eternal,
\q2 the King of all the gods;
\q
\v 4 the depths of earth lie in his hand,
\q2 the mountain-peaks are his,
\q
\v 5 he made the sea, he made the land,
\q2 and sea and land are his.
\q
\v 6 Come, let us worship and bow down,
\q2 kneeling to him who made us;
\q
\v 7 the Eternal is our God, and we
\q2 the people whom he shepherds.
\b
\q … if you would only listen to my voice to-day,
\q
\v 8 and be not stubborn as at Meribah,
\q2 as once at Massa in the wilderness,
\q
\v 9 when your forefathers doubted me,
\q2 and tested me, though they had felt my power.
\q
\v 10 For forty years I loathed that generation;
\q2 I said, “They are a senseless people,
\q2 they care not for my ways”;
\q
\v 11 so I swore in solemn anger,
\q2 they should never reach my rest.

\c 96
\q
\v 1 Sing a new song to the Eternal,
\q2 sing, all the earth, to the Eternal,
\q
\v 2 sing to the Eternal, praise him,
\q2 day after day tell of his saving aid;
\q
\v 3 let pagans hear about his glory,
\q2 let every nation know his wondrous deeds.
\q
\v 4 For great is the Eternal, loudly to be praised,
\q2 and to be feared above all gods;
\q
\v 5 for all gods of the nations are mere idols,
\q2 but the Eternal made the heavens;
\q
\v 6 grandeur and majesty attend him,
\q2 splendour and power fill his sanctuary.
\b
\q
\v 7 Praise the Eternal, O families of the nations,
\q praise the Eternal for his glory and his might!
\q
\v 8 praise the Eternal for his open glory,
\q enter his courts with an offering,
\q
\v 9 kneel before God in sacred vestments,
\q tremble before him, all the earth.
\q
\v 10 Proclaim to pagans that the Eternal reigns;
\q he has steadied and settled the world,
\q he will rule the nations justly.
\q
\v 11 Let the skies be glad, let earth rejoice,
\q let the sea and all within it thunder praise,
\q
\v 12 let the land and all it holds exult,
\q let all trees of the forest sing for joy
\q
\v 13 at the Eternal’s presence – for he comes,
\q he comes to rule the earth,
\q to rule the world with justice
\q and the nations faithfully.

\c 97
\q
\v 1 The Eternal reigns! Let earth rejoice,
\q2 let many a shore be glad.
\q
\v 2 His throne rests upon equity and justice;
\q2 clouds and darkness surround him,
\q
\v 3 fire burns in front of him
\q2 and blazes round his steps,
\q
\v 4 his lightnings illumine the world,
\q2 till earth shivers at the sight;
\q
\v 5 the mountains melt like wax
\q2 before the Lord of all the earth;
\q
\v 6 the heavens proclaim his high authority,
\q2 all nations see his majesty.
\b
\q
\v 7 All worshippers of images were confounded–
\q2 so proud of their empty idols!–
\q2 all gods lay prostrate at his feet.
\q
\v 8 Sion heard it and rejoiced,
\q2 the towns of Judah were in joy
\q2 at thy saving deeds, O thou Eternal;
\q
\v 9 for thou art the Most High o’er all the earth,
\q2 thou hast proved greater than all gods.
\b
\q
\v 10 Those who hate evil the Eternal loves,
\q2 he saves his followers alive,
\q2 rescuing them from evil men.
\q
\v 11 Light dawns for the just,
\q2 and happiness for men of upright mind;
\q
\v 12 rejoice, ye just, in the Eternal,
\q2 give thanks as you recall his sacred name.

\c 98
\d A song.
\q
\v 1 Oh sing a new song to the Eternal,
\q2 for marvels he has done,
\q by his right hand has won victory
\q2 by his majestic power;
\q
\v 2 the Eternal has let the nations see
\q2 his triumph and his victory.
\q
\v 3 He has remembered to be kind to Jacob
\q2 and loyal to the house of Israel;
\q from end to end the world has seen
\q2 the victory of our God.
\b
\q
\v 4 Shout praise, alle earth, to the Eternal,
\q2 break into music and song,
\q
\v 5 praise the Eternal with the lyre,
\q2 with the lyre and song,
\q
\v 6 shout praise before the King, the Eternal,
\q2 with bugle and cornet.
\q
\v 7 Let the sea and all within it thunder praise,
\q2 the world and its inhabitants,
\q
\v 8 let rivers clap their hands,
\q2 let mountains sing in chorus
\q
\v 9 before the Eternal – for he comes to rule the world,
\q2 to rule the world with justice,
\q2 nations with equity.

\c 99
\q
\v 1 The Eternal is king! Let the nations shake!
\q2 He is enthroned! let the world quake!
\q
\v 2 Great is the Eternal within Sion,
\q2 high over all nations.
\q
\v 3 Praise to him, so great and dread!
\q2 A mighty Majesty is he.
\b
\q
\v 4 Thou art a King, in love with justice,
\q2 thou has restored equity,
\q2 thou maintainest right and justice.
\q
\v 5 Exalt the Eternal One, our God,
\q2 and worship at his footstool;
\q2 a mighty Majesty is he.
\b
\q
\v 6 His priests have still a Moses and an Aaron,
\q2 his worshippers have still a Samuel;
\q2 and the Eternal answers when they call to him,
\q
\v 7 still through a cloudy pillar speaks to them,
\q2 when they keep the commands he has laid down.
\q
\v 8 O Eternal, our God, thou answerest them;
\q2 thou hast been a forgiving God to them,
\q2 and hast avenged their wrongs.
\b
\q
\v 9 Exalt the Eternal One, our God,
\q2 and worship at his sacred hill:
\q2 for the Eternal is a mighty Majesty.

\c 100
\d A song for the thankoffering service. 
\q 
\v 1 Shout praise, all earth, to the Eternal,
\q2 
\v 2 sacrifice gladly to the Eternal,
\q2 enter his presence with songs of praise;
\q
\v 3 confess that the Eternal is God,
\q2 ’tis he who made us, we are his,
\q2 the people whom he shepherds;
\q
\v 4 enter his gates with thanksgiving,
\q2 his courts with praise,
\q2 give thanks and praise to him,
\q
\v 5 for kind is the Eternal,
\q2 his love will last for ever,
\q2 his faithfulness from age to age. 

\c 101
\d A song of David.
\q
\v 1 I will be kind and just before thee, O Eternal;
\q
\v 2 let a just man’s case come up, and I will deal with it.
\q I will live uprightly in my own house,
\q
\v 3 I will have no base aims.
\q Apostates and their practices I hate;
\q they appeal not to me.
\q
\v 4 I banish purposes perverse,
\q I disown evil men.
\q
\v 5 If a man slanders secretly his fellow,
\q I silence him;
\q if any man is proud and haughty,
\q I will not suffer him.
\q
\v 6 I look out for the faithful in the land,
\q to have them at my court;
\q men of integrity shall be my ministers;
\q
\v 7 deceitful men shall not dwell in my household,
\q no man who tells a lie shall live with me.
\q
\v 8 I will be active to wipe out all wicked natives from the land,
\q to root out every evildoer from the Eternal’s city. 

\c 102
\d The prayer of an unhappy soul who is overwhelmed and pours out his plaint before the Eternal.
\q
\v 1 Listen to my prayer, O thou Eternal,
\q2 let my cry for help reach thee;
\q
\v 2 hide not thy face from me
\q2 on my day of trouble,
\q bend thine ear to me,
\q2 answer me quickly when I call.
\b
\q
\v 3 My days are vanishing like smoke;
\q2 my limbs are fevered like a fire,
\q
\v 4 my health is blighted, withering like grass–
\q2 I forget to take my food;
\q
\v 5 my skin is stretched tight on the bone,
\q2 so bitterly I moan.
\b
\q
\v 6 I am like a pelican in the desert,
\q2 like an owl moping in the ruins;
\q
\v 7 I cannot sleep, I mourn
\q2 like a lonely bird on the roof;
\q
\v 8 all day long my foes are taunting me,
\q2 those who mock me call me “The accursed.”
\b
\q
\v 9 I eat ashes with my food,
\q2 tears fall into my drink,
\q
\v 10 so angry and furious art thou—
\q2 thou who didst lift me and hast thrown me down!
\q
\v 11 My days are brief as any evening shadow,
\q2 and I am withering away like grass.
\b
\q
\v 23 He has broken my strength,
\q2
\v 24 he has shortened my days, till I cry: 
\q “My God, remove me not before my days are done, 
\q2 O thou whose years endure age after age!”
\b
\q
\v 12 O thou Eternal, throned for ever,
\q2 from age to age thy fame endures;
\q
\v 13 thou wilt rise and have pity on Sion—
\q2 ’tis time, ’tis time to favour her; 
\q
\v 14 her scattered stones are dear to thy servants,
\q2 and they are distressed at the dust of her ruins.
\b
\q
\v 16 When the Eternal builds up Sion, 
\q2 appearing in his majesty,
\q
\v 17 when he turns to the folorn,
\q2 despising not their prayer,
\q
\v 15 then pagans will revere thee,
\q2 all kings on earth will own thy majesty.
\b
\q
\v 19 When the Eternal bends from his sacred height,
\q2 and looks from heaven to earth,
\q
\v 20 to hear the prisoner’s groan,
\q2 and to release the doomed;
\q
\v 18 let this be set down for future generations,
\q2 that people yet unborn may praise the Eternal,
\q
\v 21 rehearsing his fame in Sion
\q2 and praising him at Jerusalem,
\q
\v 22 when realms and nations gather there
\q2 to worship the Eternal.
\b
\q
\v 25 Thou didst found the earth of old,
\q2 the heavens are the work of thy hands;
\q 
\v 26 they vanish, but thou shalt endure,
\q2 they wear out like a robe;
\q thou changest them like garments, and they change
\q2 
\v 27 but thou art still the same, O thou Eternal,
\q2 thy years never end;
\q
\v 28 and in thy presence live thy servants’ children,
\q2 and their posterity perpetually.

\c 103
\d A song of David.
\q
\v 1 Bless the Eternal, O my soul,
\q2 let all my being bless his sacred name;
\q
\v 2 bless the Eternal, O my soul,
\q2 remember all his benefits;
\q
\v 3 he pardons all your sins,
\q2 and all your sicknesses he heals,
\q
\v 4 he saves your life from death,
\q2 he crowns you with his love and pity,
\q
\v 5 he gives you all your heart’s desire,
\q renewing your youth like an eagle’s.
\b
\q
\v 6 The Eternal vindicates the cause of any who are wronged;
\q
\v 7 he let Moses see this purpose,
\q2 and Israel his methods.
\q
\v 8 The Eternal is pitiful and gracious,
\q2 slow to be angry, rich in love;
\q
\v 9 he will not always chafe,
\q2 he will not hold to his anger for all time;
\q
\v 10 he treats us not according to our sins,
\q2 he deals not with us as our guilt deserves;
\q
\v 11 but, high as heaven is over earth,
\q2 so vast his love is to his worshippers;
\q
\v 12 far as the east is from the west,
\q2 so far he puts our sins away from us.
\q
\v 13 As a father pities his children,
\q2 so the Eternal pities his worshippers;
\q
\v 14 he knows what we are made of,
\q2 he remembers we are dust.
\q
\v 15 Poor man! — his days are like the grass,
\q2 he blooms like a flower in the meadow;
\q
\v 16 at the breath of a breeze it is gone,
\q2 and its place never sees it again.
\q
\v 17 But the Eternal’s love is everlasting,
\q2 his loyalty goes on to children’s children,
\q
\v 18 when they obey his compact
\q2 and remember to do his bidding.
\b
\q
\v 19 In heaven has the Eternal fixed his throne,
\q2 and his dominion covers all the world.
\q
\v 20 Bless the Eternal, O his angels,
\q2 strong spirits who obey his word!
\q
\v 21 Bless the Eternal, all his hosts,
\q2 servants who carry out his will!
\q
\v 22 Bless the Eternal, all his works,
\q2 in every sphere of his dominion!

\c 104
\q
\v 1 Bless the Eternal, O my soul!
\q2 Eternal One, my God, thou art most great,
\q2 arrayed in glorious majesty.
\q
\v 2 Thou wrappest thyself in a robe of light,
\q2 thou spreadest the sky like a tent,
\q2
\v 3 thou buildest thy chambers on the waters above;
\q thou makest clouds thy chariot,
\q2 thou ridest on the wings of the wind;
\q
\v 4 thou makest winds thy messengers,
\q2 fire and flame thy servants.
\b 
\q
\v 5 Thou didst found the earth upon its pillars,
\q2 never to be shaken,
\q
\v 6 drawing the deep over it,
\q2 till the waters stood above the mountains;
\q
\v 7 but they retired at thy rebuke,
\q2 scared at the sound of thy thunder,
\q
\v 9 never to pass thine appointed bounds,
\q2 or cover the earth again;
\q
\v 8 the mountains rose, the valleys sank,
\q2 to the place made for them.
\b
\q
\v 10 He pours the streams into the valleys,
\q2 that flow between the mountains,
\q
\v 11 where all the wild beasts drink,
\q2 wild-asses quench their thirst;
\q
\v 12 there the wild birds settle,
\q2 singing among the branches;
\q
\v 16 and the great trees drink their fill,
\q2 the cedars the Eternal sowed on Lebânon,
\q
\v 17 where the birds build their nests,
\q2 the stork with her home in the cypress.
\b
\q
\v 18 The high hills shelter the wild goat,
\q2 the marmot hides in the rocks.
\q
\v 13 He waters the hills from his high chambers,
\q2 and rains abundantly upon the land,
\q
\v 14 till grass grows for the cattle,
\q2 and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind;
\q that he may bring food from the earth,
\q2
\v 15 wine to cheer up the heart of man,
\q oil, that his skin may shine,
\q2 bread to sustain his strength.
\b
\q
\v 19 He marks the seasons by the moon,
\q2 he tells the sun when it must set.
\q
\v 20 Thou makest it dark; night falls,
\q2 and every wild beast in the wood is moving—
\q
\v 21 lions roaring for their prey
\q2 and claiming food from God;
\q
\v 22 when the sun rises, then they slink away
\q2 to lie down in their lairs,
\q
\v 23 but man comes out to work,
\q2 and labours till the evening.
\b
\q
\v 24 How manifold thy works, Eternal One,
\q2 all of them wisely made!
\q
\v 25 Yonder the sea lies, vast and broad,
\q2 with its countless swarms,
\q2 with creatures small and great,
\q
\v 26 with fleets of the nautilus,
\q2 with leviathan at his play!
\q
\v 24c The world is full of thy creatures,
\q3
\v 27 all looking to thee
\q2 for their food in season due;
\q
\v 28 what thou givest, that they gather,
\q2 feasting from thine open hand.
\q
\v 29 But when thy face is hidden, they are scared,
\q2 when thou recallest their breath, they die.
\q
\v 30 Yet a breath from thee brings them into being,
\q2 renewing the face of the earth.
\q
\v 31 For ever may the glorious might of the Eternal last!
\q2 May the Eternal joy in his own works!
\q
\v 32 Earth trembles at a glance from him,
\q2 the mountains smoke at his touch.
\q
\v 33 Long as I live, I will sing to the Eternal,
\q2 and praise my God while I have breath.
\q
\v 34 May these my thoughts please him—
\q2 I find my joy in the Eternal!
\q
\v 35 May sinners be swept out of the world,
\q2 may evil men no longer live in it!
\q Bless the Eternal, O my soul!
\q2 Hallelujah!

\c 105
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to the Eternal, proclaim his fame, 
\q2 celebrate his deeds among the nations, 
\q
\v 2 sing to him, make music to him, 
\q2 go over all the wonders he has done, 
\q
\v 3 glory in his sacred name, 
\q2 let the Eternal’s worshippers rejoice in heart. 
\q
\v 4 Worship the Eternal and his might, 
\q2 worship in his presence evermore; 
\q
\v 5 never forget the wonders he has done, 
\q2 his marvels and his sentences of doom, 
\q
\v 6 O race of Abraham his servant, 
\q2 O sons of Jacob whom he chose.
\b
\q
\v 7 The Eternal, he is our God, 
\q2 supreme over all nations.
\q
\v 8 He never forgets his compact,
\q2 the pledge given for a thousand generations,
\q
\v 9 the compact made with Abraham,
\q2 the oath he swore to Isaac,
\q
\v 10 confirming it as a degree to Jacob,
\q2 for Israel as a lasting compact,
\q
\v 11 that he would give them Canaan’s land,
\q2 to hold it as their own possession.
\b
\q
\v 12 Few in number were our fathers,
\q2 few and foreigners;
\q
\v 13 wandering from one nation to another,
\q2 and from realm to realm;
\q
\v 14 but he would not let a man oppress them,
\q2 he would punish kings on their account,
\q
\v 15 saying, “‘ Never touch my chosen,
\q never harm my prophets.”
\b
\q
\v 16 He called a famine on the land,
\q2 destroying all the Egyptians’ sustenance.
\q
\v 17 He sent a man in front of them,
\q2 Joseph, sold as a slave;
\q
\v 18 his feet were forced into fetters,
\q2 he was laid in irons,
\q
\v 19 till the promise of the Eternal came true,
\q2 the promise that tested him.
\q
\v 20 Then the king sent and released him,
\q2 the monarch set him free,
\q
\v 21 and made him master of his palace,
\q2 lord of all that he possessed,
\q
\v 22 to control his nobles as he pleased,
\q2 and dictate to his councillors.
\b
\q
\v 23 Then Israel entered Egypt,
\q2 Jacob lived in the land of Khem.
\q
\v 24 God multiplied his people greatly,
\q2 till they outnumbered the Egyptians,
\q
\v 25 who turned to hate his people, 
\q2 to handle his servants craftily. 
\q
\v 26 So he sent his servant Moses, 
\q2 and Aaron whom he chose; 
\q
\v 27 he wrought portents within Egypt, 
\q2 marvels in the land of Khem; 
\q
\v 28 darkness he sent, he made it dark, 
\q2 but they would not heed his word; 
\q
\v 29 he turned their waters into blood, 
\q2 and killed their fish; 
\q
\v 30 frogs swarmed over their country, 
\q2 into the very chambers of the king; 
\q
\v 31 dog-flies swarmed at his command, 
\q2 and lice through all their land; 
\q
\v 32 he gave them hail for rain, 
\q2 and fire flashed over the land, 
\q
\v 33 striking their vines and fig-trees, 
\q2 breaking the trees of the country; 
\q
\v 34 at his bidding locusts came, 
\q2 and grasshoppers past counting, 
\q
\v 35 that ate up all the green growth of the land, 
\q2 and all the crops; 
\q
\v 36 he struck down all the first-born in their land, 
\q2 each oldest male child.
\b
\q
\v 37 Then he led out his clansmen, 
\q2 carrying spoil of gold and silver, 
\q2 not a weary man among them;
\q
\v 38 glad was Egypt when they left, 
\q2 for they were dreaded.
\q
\v 39 He spread out clouds to shelter them, 
\q2 and lit them in the night with fire;
\q
\v 40 he sent them quails, at their demand, 
\q2 and bread of heaven in plenty;
\q
\v 41 he opened rocks, and through the sand
\q2 water rushed like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he remembered his own sacred pledge
\q2 to Abraham his servant.
\q
\v 43 So he brought his people out with joy,
\q2 his chosen with a song and shout;
\q
\v 44 he gave them the lands of the nations,
\q2 and they possessed the fruit of others’ toils
\q
\v 45 ’Twas all to make them carry out his orders
\q2 and obey his laws.

\c 106
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah!
\q Give thanks to the Eternal! – he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails.
\q
\v 2 Who can proclaim the Eternal’s mighty deeds,
\q2 or do full justice to his praise?
\b
\q
\v 3 Happy are they who hold to what is right,
\q2 who do their duty at all times!
\q
\v 5 They share the welfare of thy chosen band,
\q2 thy nation’s joy, the triumph of thy land.
\b
\q
\v 4 Remember us in thy goodwill, Eternal,
\q2 oh save and prosper thine own people.
\q
\v 6 For, like our fathers, we have sinned,
\q2 we have done evil, have done wickedly.
\q
\v 7 At the Reed Sea our fathers defied the Most High,
\q2 heedless of his wonders done in Egypt,
\q2 forgetting all the kindness he had shown them.
\q
\v 8 Yet he saved them for his own sake,
\q2 to display his power;
\q
\v 9 the Reed Sea dried up at his bidding,
\q2 through the deep he led them like a desert,
\q
\v 10 saving them from hostile hands,
\q2 rescuing them from the foe;
\q
\v 11 the waters rose over their enemies,
\q2 till not a man was left.
\q
\v 12 Then they believed his promise,
\q2 and they sang his praise.
\q
\v 13 But soon they forgot what he had done,
\q2 they would not be patient with his purposes;
\q
\v 14 they had a craving in the wilderness,
\q2 that made them doubt God in the desert;
\q
\v 15 he let them have what they desired.
\q2 then – made them loathe it!
\q
\v 16 When they were jealous of Moses in the camp,
\q2 and of Aaron, whom the Eternal consecrated,
\q
\v 18 fire broke out in their company,
\q2 and flames burned up the wicked;
\q
\v 17 earth opened and swallowed Dathan up,
\q2 and closed over Abiram’s crew.
\q
\v 19 At Horeb they made a calf,
\q2 and worshipped a metal image,
\q
\v 20 bartering God their glory
\q2 for the image of an ox that munches grass!
\q
\v 21 They forgot God their deliverer,
\q2 who had done great deeds in Egypt,
\q
\v 22 marvels in the land of Khem,
\q2 deeds of awe at the Reed Sea.
\q
\v 23 So he threatened to destroy them,
\q2 had not Moses stepped into the breach,
\q had not Moses, whom he had chosen, faced him,
\q2 to avert his deadly wrath.
\q
\v 24 And then they scorned the land of delight;
\q2 they would not believe what he promised,
\q
\v 25 but grumbled in their tents
\q2 and would not listen to his word;
\q
\v 26 so he swore solemnly
\q2 to lay them low in the desert,
\q
\v 27 to scatter their children among heathen men,
\q2 and disperse them over the world.
\q
\v 28 When they joined the Baal of Pĕor,
\q2 and ate food offered to the dead,
\q
\v 29 they angered him with their misdeeds,
\q2 and plague broke out among them.
\q
\v 30 But Phinehas rose to interpose,
\q2 and so the plague was checked–
\q
\v 31 which was counted in his favour,
\q2 as a merit for all time.
\q
\v 32a At the waters of Merîbah they enraged God,
\q2
\v 33a rebelling against his Spirit,
\q
\v 32b till they made Moses go wrong
\q2
\v 33b and utter words in haste.
\q
\v 34 Nor did they root out the pagans,
\q2 as the Eternal ordered;
\q
\v 35 they mixed with heathen men
\q2 and learned their ways,
\q
\v 36 and worshipping their idols
\q2 were ensnared;
\q
\v 37 they sacrificed to demons,
\q2 sacrificed their sons and daughters,
\q
\v 38 pouring out innocent blood,
\q2 till the land was stained with murder.
\q
\v 39 They were befouled by what they did,
\q2 and broke faith by their practices.
\q
\v 40 So the Eternal’s anger blazed against his people,
\q2 he loathed his heritage;
\q
\v 41 he abandoned them to pagans,
\q2 to be ruled by those who hated them;
\q
\v 42 their foes oppressed them,
\q2 forced them to submission.
\q
\v 43 Many a time he rescued them;
\q2 but they would take their own rebellious way,
\q2 till evil-doing wasted them away.
\q
\v 44 Yet he regarded their distress,
\q2 when he heard them wailing;
\q
\v 45 he remembered for their sake his compact,
\q2 in his great goodness he relented;
\q
\v 46 he made their very captors
\q2 have compassion upon them.
\b
\q
\v 47 O thou Eternal, our God, save us,
\q2 gather us out of the nations,
\q that we may give thanks to thy sacred name,
\q2 and triumph in thy deeds of praise.
\b
\q
\v 48 [[Blessed be the Eternal, Israel’s God, from age to age, for ever!
\q2 Let all the people add “Amen.”]]
\b

\c 107
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah!
\q “Give thanks to the Eternal! – he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails!”
\q
\v 2 Be this the song of the redeemed,
\q2 redeemed by the Eternal from their foes,
\q
\v 3 gathered from lands afar,
\q2 from east and west, from north and south.
\q
\v 4 Some wandered in the lonely wilderness,
\q2 they could not find a settled town;
\q
\v 5 their soul was faint
\q2 with hunger and with thirst.
\q
\v 6 They cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight,
\q
\v 7 and straight he led them
\q2 to a settled town.
\q
\v 8 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\q
\v 9 he satisfies their longing thirst,
\q2 and fills them in their hunger.
\b
\q
\v 10 Some lay in darkness and in gloom,
\q2 prisoners in chains and misery,
\q
\v 11 because they had rebelled at God’s commands
\q2 and scorned what the Most High enjoined;
\q
\v 12 hard labour crushed their spirit,
\q2 and wearied out, forlorn,
\q
\v 13 they cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\q
\v 14 he took them from the darkness and the gloom,
\q2 and snapped their chains.
\q
\v 15 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\q
\v 16 he breaks the gates of bronze,
\q2 and shatters iron bars.
\b
\q
\v 17 Some, weakened by their sinful ways,
\q2 were sick and suffering by evildoing;
\q
\v 18 they had a loathing for all food,
\q2 they were on the verge of death;
\q
\v 19 they cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\q
\v 20 he sent his word to heal them
\q2 and preserve their life.
\q
\v 21 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\q
\v 22 let them offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q2 and joyfully recount what he has done.
\b
\q
\v 23 Some crossed the sea in ships,
\q2 trading in great waters;
\q
\v 24 they saw what the Eternal does,
\q2 his marvels in the deep.
\q
\v 25 When the wind rose at his bidding,
\q2 and the waves tossed with the storm,
\q
\v 26 they soared to heaven, sank to the depth,
\q2 their courage melting;
\q
\v 27 they reeled and staggered like a drunken man,
\q2 and were at their wit’s end.
\q
\v 28 They cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\q
\v 29 he stilled the storm to a whisper,
\q2 till the waves were hushed.
\q
\v 30 Glad were they for the calm,
\q2 and then he brought them to their longed-for haven.
\q
\v 31 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\q
\v 32 let them extol him, when the people meet,
\q2 and praise him in the council of the sheikhs.
\q
\v 33 He turns streams into a desert,
\q2 and fountains into dry land;
\q
\v 34 he turns an oasis into a salt waste,
\q2 to punish people for their sins.
\q
\v 35 He turns a desert into pools of water,
\q2 and dry land into fountains,
\q
\v 36 where he settles famished folk,
\q2 to build a town to settle in,
\q
\v 37 sowing fields and planting vineyards,
\q2 gathering in their harvest;
\q
\v 38 by his blessing they increase,
\q2 and their herds never diminish.
\q
\v 40 He pours contempt on lords,
\q2 and sets them in a pathless waste astray,
\q
\v 39 till they grow few and faint
\q2 under the weight of misery.
\q
\v 41 But he lifts poor men from their woes,
\q2 and makes their household like a fruitful flock.
\q
\v 42 Good men rejoice to see this,
\q2 and wrongdoers are silenced.
\q
\v 43 Let any wise man ponder this,
\q2 and lay to heart how kind the Eternal is.

\d A song of David, for music.
\q
\v 1 My heart is ready, O God,
\q2 for song and melody.
\q
\v 2 Awake, my soul! awake, my lute and lyre!
\q2 Let me awake the dawn!
\b
\q
\v 3 I would praise thee, O Eternal, among the peoples,
\q2 I would chant thee among the nations,
\q
\v 4 for thy love is high over heaven,
\q2 thy loyalty soars to the skies.
\b
\q
\v 5 Up, O God, high over heaven!
\q2 Up with thy glory over all the earth!
\q
\v 6 To the rescue of thy dear folk!
\q2 Save by thy right hand, answer our entreaty.
\b
\q
\v 7 God gave his sacred promise:
\q2 “I will divide up Shechem in triumph,
\q2 and parcel out the vale of Sukkoth;
\q
\v 8 Gilead is mine, Manasseh mine,
\q2 Ephraim I take for helmet,
\q2 Judah for my baton,
\q
\v 9 Moab I make a wash-basin,
\q2 Edom I claim as subject,
\q2 and over Philistia I will triumph.”
\q
\v 10 Ah, who will lead us inside the hill-fort?
\q2 Who will take us conquering into Edom?
\q
\v 11 Hast thou not discarded us, shamed us, O God?
\q2 thou would’st not march out with our army.
\b
\q
\v 12 Help us against the foe,
\q2 for man’s help is in vain.
\q
\v 13 With God we shall do bravely;
\q2 he will trample down our foes.

\c 109
\d From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\q
\v 1 God of my praise, be not thou silent;
\q
\v 2 for wicked men are loud against me,
\q2 falsely charging me;
\q
\v 3 they beset me with their words of malice,
\q2 they attack me wantonly;
\q
\v 4 they return enmity for love,
\q2 even as I pray for them,
\q
\v 5 rewarding me with cruelty for my kindness,
\q2 and hatred for my love.
\q
\v 6 Arrest yon evil knave,
\q2 let some accuser face him;
\q
\v 7 let him be tried and sentence,
\q2 let his prayer pass for a sin!
\q
\v 8 Few days be his!
\q2 May another seize his office!
\q
\v 9 May his children become fatherless,
\q2 his wife a widow!
\q
\v 10 May they be vagabonds and beggars,
\q2 driven out of their ruined home!
\q
\v 11 May creditors seize all he has,
\q2 and strangers help themselves to all he made!
\q
\v 12 May not a soul be kind to him,
\q2 may no one pity his fatherless children!
\q
\v 13 May his posterity be rooted out,
\q2 and his name blotted out in a single generation!
\q
\v 14 But never may his father’s evil be forgotten,
\q2 or his mother's sin be blotted out!
\q
\v 15 (The Eternal ever keep them in his mind,
\q2 to root them from the earth!)
\q
\v 16 Never did he remember to be kind;
\q2 but wretched, weak, and broken-hearted creatures
\q2 he persecuted to the death.
\q
\v 17 He would not bless? – blessings be far from him!
\q2 He loved to curse? – may curses light on him!
\q
\v 18 May curses cling to him like clothes!
\q2 Curses soak into him like water,
\q2 sink to his very bones like oil!
\q
\v 19 May curses be the garment he puts on!
\q2 curses be like his girdle day by day!
\q
\v 20 So may the Eternal reward my accusers,
\q2 and all who threaten my life!
\q
\v 21 O Lord the Eternal, act on my behalf,
\q2 oh rescue me in thy kind love;
\q
\v 22 for I am weak and wretched,
\q2 my heart is in anguish,
\q
\v 23 my days are brief as any evening shadow,
\q2 I am whirled off like a locust,
\q
\v 24 my knees are giving way with fasting,
\q2 my flesh is thin and shrivelled;
\q
\v 25 they are taunting, taunting me,
\q2 tossing their heads at the sight of me!
\q
\v 26 Eternal One, my God, oh help me,
\q2 save me in thy love–
\q
\v 27 to let them know thy power by this,
\q2 what thou canst do, Eternal One!
\q
\v 28 They may curse, but do thou bless;
\q2 confounded by my foes, but let thy servant joy.
\q
\v 29 May my opponents be covered with disgrace,
\q2 robed in their own dishonour!
\b
\q
\v 30 I will give thanks aloud to the Eternal;
\q2 yes, I will praise him in the congregation,
\q
\v 31 for he supports a helpless man,
\q2 to save him from his persecutors

\c 110
\d A song of David.
\q
\v 1 The Eternal has this oracle for my lord:
\q2 “Sit throned at my right hand,
\q2 until I make you foes your footstool.”
\q
\v 2 Yes, the Eternal shall send you from Sion
\q2 the sceptre of your sway,
\q to let you reign amid your foes,
\q2 arrayed in sacred vestments.
\q
\v 3 The day you come to power, you are supreme,
\q2 vital and fresh like dewdrops of the dawn;
\q
\v 4 “you are to be a priest for life”–
\q2 so swears the Eternal, his oath will not change–
\q2 “a priest as once Melkizedek was.”
\q
\v 5 The Lord is at your side,
\q2 shattering kings upon his day of wrath.
\q
\v 6 He sends pagans to their doom,
\q2 filling the valleys with their corpses,
\q2 shattering their chiefs far and wide;
\q
\v 7 he drinks from any stream he crosses,
\q2 then charges forward, triumphing.

\c 111
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q With all my heart I thank the Eternal,
\q2 in gatherings of good men for fellowship.
\q
\v 2 Great are the Eternal’s doings,
\q2 to be studied by all who delight in them;
\q
\v 3 splendid and glorious are his deeds,
\q2 his victories know no end;
\q
\v 3 he will have us celebrate his wondrous deeds,
\q2 for the Eternal is gracious and pitiful.
\q
\v 5 He feeds his worshippers;
\q2 never does he forget his compact.
\q
\v 6 He has shown his people his power in action,
\q2 as he gave them the homes of the heathen.
\q
\v 7 Faithfully he deals and justly,
\q2 trustworthy are all his precepts;
\q
\v 8 his orders are enacted for all time,
\q2 issued in faithfulness and justice.
\q
\v 9 He has sent his people freedom,
\q2 fixing his compact with them for all time–
\q2 a God majestic, terrible.
\q
\v 10 The first thing in knowledge is reverence for the Eternal:
\q2 it is sound sense for everyone;
\q2 his praise endures for ever.

\c 112
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q Happy the man who reverences the Eternal,
\q2 who finds rich joy in his commands!
\q
\v 2 His children shall rise to power within the land;
\q2 the race of the upright are blessed.
\q
\v 3 Riches and wealth are in his house,
\q2 good fortune never fails him.
\q
\v 4 Light dawns upon the good man,
\q2 the upright man so mild and merciful.
\q
\v 5 All goes well with the generous, open-handed,
\q2 who will act fairly;
\q
\v 6 never shall that man come to grief;
\q2 the good man’s memory never fades.
\q
\v 7 He has no fear of evil tidings,
\q2 he trusts the Eternal with a steady heart;
\q
\v 8 his heart is firm and fearless,
\q2 certain that he will see his foes collapse.
\q
\v 9 He gives to the poor lavishly,
\q2 and so good fortune never fails him–
\q2 he rises to high power and honour.
\q
\v 10 Ungodly men look on and grieve,
\q2 they gnash their teeth and – disappear;
\q2 the ungodly’s hope will come to nothing.

\c 113
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q Praise the Eternal, servants of the Eternal, praise his name!
\q
\v 2 Blessed be the Eternal’s name from now and evermore!
\q
\v 3 Praise to the Eternal’s name from sunrise to sunset!
\b
\q
\v 4 The Eternal is supreme over the nations, majestic over the heavens.
\q
\v 5 Who is like the Eternal, our God, dwelling in high heaven,
\q
\v 6 stooping to cast his eyes on earth below?
\b
\q
\v 7 He raises poor men from the dust, the wretched from the dunghill,
\q
\v 8 to seat them beside princes, the princes of his people;
\q
\v 9 makes the barren wife a happy mother in her home.

\c 114
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q When Israel went from Egypt,
\q2 and Jacob’s household from a foreign folk,
\q
\v 2 Judah he took to be his own,
\q2 and Israel his for domain.
\b
\q
\v 3 The sea fled at the sight of it,
\q2 Jordan made way for them;
\q
\v 4 the mountains leaped like rams,
\q2 the hills like lambs.
\q
\v 5 What ails you, sea, that you thus flee?
\q2 Jordan, that you make way?
\q
\v 6 you mountains, to leap thus like rams?
\q2 you hills like lambs?
\b
\q
\v 7 Aye, tremble, earth, at the Eternal’s presence,
\q2 before Jacob’s God,
\q
\v 8 who turns a rock into a pool,
\q2 flint into fountains!

\c 115
\q
\v 1 Not for us, O thou Eternal, not for us,
\q2 but for thyself, win praise,
\q2 to prove that thou thyself art kind and true.
\q
\v 2 Why should pagans sneer,
\q2 “Where is that God of theirs?”
\q
\v 3 Ah, he is in heaven, our God,
\q2 he does whate’er he pleases.
\q
\v 4 Their idols are mere gold and silver,
\q2 made by the hands of men,
\q
\v 5 with mouths – but they never speak,
\q2 with eyes – but they cannot see,
\q
\v 6 with ears – but they cannot hear,
\q2 with noses – but they cannot smell,
\q
\v 7 with hands – but they cannot feel,
\q2 with feet – but they cannot walk!
\q
\v 8 No sound from them!
\q2 No breath of life is in them!
\q So be it with their makers,
\q2 with all who trust in them!
\b
\q
\v 9 But Israel trusts in the Eternal;
\q2 he is their shield and succour.
\q
\v 10 Aaron’s household trusts in the Eternal;
\q2 he is their shield and succour.
\q
\v 11 The Eternal’s worshippers trust in the Eternal;
\q2 he is their shield and succour.
\q
\v 12 The Eternal remembers us, and he will bless us,
\q2 he will bless Israel and Aaron’s household,
\q
\v 13 he will bless his worshippers,
\q2 both high and low alike.
\q
\v 14 The Eternal will make you increase,
\q2 will multiply you and your children.
\q
\v 15 Your blessing comes from the Eternal,
\q2 who made heaven and earth,
\q
\v 16 the heaven that the Eternal holds himself,
\q2 the earth he has assigned to men.
\b
\q
\v 17 The dead cannot praise the Eternal,
\q2 nor any who sink to the silent land;
\q2 but we bless the Eternal now and evermore.

\c 116
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q I love to know that the Eternal listens
\q2 to the voice of my appeal;
\q
\v 2 because he bends his ear to me,
\q2 I will pray to him all my life.
\q
\v 3 Death had netted me, in desperate straits,
\q2 I was in anguish and despair;
\q
\v 4 so I appealed to the Eternal,
\q2 “O thou Eternal, save my life!”
\q
\v 5 Tender and true is the Eternal,
\q2 our God indeed is pitiful;
\q
\v 6 the Eternal protects poor souls–
\q2 when I am helpless, he is my help.
\b
\q
\v 7 Return to thy rest, O my soul,
\q2 for the Eternal has dealt lovingly with thee.
\q
\v 8 Thou has saved my life from death,
\q2 mine eyes from tears,
\q
\v 9 I will live mindful of thee now
\q2 in the land of the living.
\b
\q
\v 10 Though I cried out, “I am crushed,”
\q
\v 11 thinking, in my distraction, “All men are a failure,”
\q2 yet I had faith.
\q
\v 12 Now, what can I render to the Eternal
\q2 for all his benefits to me?
\q
\v 13 I will offer a libation for my rescue,
\q2 and proclaim the Eternal aloud;
\q
\v 14 I will pay what I vowed to the Eternal,
\q2 in the presence of all his people.
\q
\v 15 Precious in the eyes of the Eternal
\q2 is the death of his devoted.
\q
\v 16 Eternal One, I am indeed thy servant,
\q2 thy servant, thy retainer;
\q2 thou hast delivered me.
\q
\v 17 I will offer thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q2 and proclaim the Eternal aloud;
\q
\v 18 I will pay what I vowed to the Eternal,
\q2 in the presence of all his people,
\q
\v 19 in the courts of the Eternal’s house,
\q2 within thee, O Jerusalem.

\c 117
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q Praise the Eternal, all ye nations,
\q2 laud him, all ye races;
\q
\v 2 for his love to us is vast,
\q2 his loyalty will ever last.

\c 118
\qc
\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q Give thanks to the Eternal! – he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails.
\q
\v 2 Let Israel repeat,
\q2 “His kindness never fails”;
\q
\v 3 let Aaron’s household repeat,
\q2 “His kindness never fails”;
\q
\v 4 let the Eternal’s worshippers repeat,
\q2 “His kindness never fails.”
\b
\q
\v 5 I was hard pressed, I called to the Eternal;
\q2 the Eternal answered, and he set me free.
\q
\v 6 The Eternal is upon my side; I have no fear.
\q2 What can man do to me?
\q
\v 7 I have the Eternal as my Helper;
\q2 so shall I feast mine eyes on my defeated foes.
\q
\v 8 Far better rely on the Eternal than put faith in men;
\q2 far better rely on the Eternal than put faith in princes.
\q
\v 10 The pagans all swarmed around me;
\q2 I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
\q
\v 11 They swarmed around me, they beset me;
\q2 I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
\q
\v 12 They swarmed like bees about me;
\q2 I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
\q They blazed like a fire among thorns;
\q2 I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
\q
\v 13 Hard pressed was I, about to fall,
\q2 but the Eternal helped me.
\q
\v 14 The Eternal is my strength, of him I sing,
\q2 he has delivered me indeed.
\b
\q
\v 15 Hark, the joyful shout of triumph in the tents of the just!–
\q “The Eternal’s right hand carries the day,”
\q
\v 16 “The Eternal’s right hand triumphs,”
\q “The Eternal’s right hand carries the day!”
\q
\v 17 I shall not die, but live
\q to proclaim the Eternal’s deeds;
\q
\v 18 The Eternal has been chastening me sorely,
\q but he has not left me to die.
\b
\q
\v 19 Open to me the gates of Victory,
\q2 that I may enter in to thank the Eternal.
\q
\v 20 “Here is the Eternal’s gate;
\q2 the just alone can enter.”
\q
\v 21 Thanks unto thee for answering me,
\q2 for thy deliverance.
\q
\v 22 The stone the builders cast aside
\q2 is now the building’s strength and pride;
\q
\v 23 this is the doing of the Eternal–
\q2 we can but watch and wonder.
\b 
\q
\v 24 This is a day we owe to the Eternal;
\q2 let us be glad and rejoice in it.
\q
\v 25 O thou Eternal, lend thine aid!
\q2 O thou Eternal, prosper us!
\q
\v 26 In the Eternal’s name, blessed be he who enters!
\q2 We bless you from the house of the Eternal,
\q2
\v 27 our God, the Eternal, who has brought light to us.
\q Round and round the altar dance,
\q2 waving your boughs, linked together,
\q
\v 28 singing, “Thou art my God, I praise thee,
\q2 thou art my God, I extol thee.”
\q
\v 29 Give thanks to the Eternal! – he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails.

\c 119
\q
\v 1 Happy are they who live uprightly, living by the Eternal’s law!
\q2
\v 2 Happy are they who follow his injunctions, giving him undivided hearts,
\q2
\v 3 who do no wrong, who keep to his paths!
\q
\v 4 Thou has laid down thy behests for us to do them diligently;
\q2
\v 5 oh that my life were set on thine obedience!
\q2
\v 6 No shame befalls me when I heed thy commands.
\q
\v 7 As I learn the justice of thy rulings, I thank thee with unfeignèd heart;
\q2
\v 8 I will obey thee: never do thou forsake me.
\b
\q
\v 9 How can a young man keep life clean? By keeping to thy word.
\q2
\v 10 I give thee an undivided heart; oh never may I stray from thy control!
\q
\v 11 I store thy word within my heart, to keep myself from sinning against thee.
\q
\v 12 Blessed be thou, O Eternal; teach my thy will.
\q2
\v 13 My lips recount all that thy lips enjoin;
\q2
\v 14 I find more joy in thine injunctions than in any wealth.
\q
\v 15 I muse on thy behests and mark thy paths;
\q2
\v 16 I delight in thy will, I never forget thy word.
\b
\q
\v 17 Deal kindly with thy servant, that I live to do thy bidding;
\q2
\v 18 open mine eyes to see the wonders of thy law;
\q2
\v 19 hide not thy commands from me, an alien on the earth.
\q
\v 20 My soul yearns all the time for thee to intervene,
\q2
\v 21 to check the arrogant, to curse all those who swerve from thy control;
\q2
\v 22 relieve me from their insults and contempt, for I follow thine injunctions.
\q
\v 23 Nobles may plan to attack me, but thy servant muses on thine orders;
\q2 
\v 24 my advisers are thine own injunctions – I delight in them.
\b
\q
\v 25 My soul is bowed to the dust: revive me, as thou hast promised;
\q2
\v 26 teach me thine orders, thou who answerest me when I tell thee my plight;
\q2
\v 27 show me how thy will works, that I may muse upon thy wondrous deeds.
\q
\v 28 My soul is melting under trouble: nerve me as thou hast promised;
\q2
\v 29 keep me from being false to thee, and graciously direct me.
\q
\v 30 A faithful life is what I choose, thy demands I desire;
\q2
\v 31 O thou Eternal, disappoint me not, I bind me to thy bidding;
\q2
\v 32 I will obey thee eagerly, as thou dost open up my life.
\b
\q
\v 33 Teach me, Eternal, how thine orders run, and I will follow to the end;
\q2
\v 34 instruct me how to carry out thy law, and I will keep it with all my heart;
\q2
\v 35 lead me in thine obedience, for it is my joy.
\q
\v 36 Incline my heart to thy behests, and to no love of gain,
\q2
\v 37 make me alive to follow thee, and turn mine eyes from cravings vain.
\q
\v 38 Fulfil thy promise to thy servant, to advance thy faith;
\q2
\v 39 remove the insults that I dread, and intervene for good;
\q2
\v 40 as thou art true, revive me; I am yearning for thy will.
\b
\q
\v 41 Let thy love come to my rescue, as thou has promised;
\q2
\v 42 then I can face my revilers, relying on thy promise;
\q2
\v 43 leave me not speechless for the truth: my hope is, thou wilt intervene.
\q
\v 44 I would obey thy law continually, always and evermore;
\q2
\v 45 let me live unhampered, for I study thy behests.
\q
\v 46 I bear testimony to thy law before kings, unashamed;
\q2
\v 47 I take delight in thy commands, so dear to me,
\q2
\v 48 I adore thy commands and muse upon thine orders.
\b
\q
\v 49 Remember thy promise to thy servant, for thou didst bid me hope;
\q2
\v 50 this comforts me in trouble, thy promise puts life into me.
\q
\v 51 Arrogant men may deride me, but from thy law I never swerve;
\q2
\v 52 I console myself, remembering thy judgments of old.
\q2
\v 53 Hot indignation seizes me at the ungodly who forsake thy law.
\q
\v 54 Thy statutes are my songs, as I wander through the world.
\q2
\v 55 I remember thy name by night and I obey thy law;
\q2
\v 56 this is my blessed lot, to carry out thy behests.
\b
\q
\v 57 Yes, O Eternal, to obey thy bidding, this is my lot;
\q2
\v 58 with all my heart I pray thee to revive me, as thou hast promised.
\q
\v 59 Thinking on how to live, I turn to thy directions,
\q2
\v 60 I hasten instantly to follow thy commands;
\q2
\v 61 evil men may ensnare me, but I never forget thy law.
\q
\v 62 At midnight I rise to praise thee for thy just interventions;
\q2
\v 63 I keep company with all thy worshippers who carry out thy will;
\q2
\v 64 teach me thine orders, for the world is full of thy goodness.
\b
\q
\v 65 Thou has been good to thy servant, as thou didst promise;
\q2
\v 66 train me in judgment and knowledge, for I believe in thy commands;
\q2
\v 67 before my trouble I went wrong, but now I do thy bidding.
\q
\v 68 Thou art good and doest good, teach me thine orders;
\q2
\v 69 proud men bespatter me with lies, but I carry out thy behests;
\q2
\v 70 their minds are gross and dull, but I thrill to thy law.
\q
\v 71 It is good for me to have been in trouble – to learn thy will;
\q2
\v 72 thy law means more to me than piles of gold and silver.
\b
\q
\v 73 Thy hands made and moulded me, to understand thine orders;
\q2
\v 74 may thy worshippers rejoice to see me waiting on thy word!
\q
\v 75 Just are thy dealings, I know, thou wert faithful in afflicting me;
\q2
\v 76 but now console me with thy love, as thou has promised thy servant;
\q2
\v 77 let thy compassion bring me life, for my delight is in thy law.
\q
\v 78 Confound the arrogant who illtreat me, as I muse on thy behests;
\q2
\v 79 let thy worshippers learn how thou rulest, by turning to my case;
\q2
\v 80 let my obedience to thee be perfect, that I may not be disgraced.
\b
\q
\v 81 My soul pines for thy saving aid, I am waiting for thy promise;
\q2
\v 82 I pine with looking for thy promises; when wilt thou comfort me?
\q2
\v 83 Though shrivelled like a wineskin in the smoke, I never forget thine orders.
\q
\v 84 How few thy servant’s days? When wilt thou doom my persecutors?
\q2
\v 85 Insolent creatures, reckless of thy law, they dig pitfalls for me;
\q2
\v 86 help me against their wanton wiles, O faithful lawgiver!
\q
\v 87 They nearly made an end of me, but I would not give up thy laws;
\q2
\v 88 as thou art loving, revive me, and I will do thy bidding.
\b
\q
\v 89 O thou Eternal, evermore thy law stands fast in heaven,
\q2
\v 90 thy faithful promise holds from age to age, sure upon earth;
\q2
\v 91 thy rule and order last to-day, for all things are thy servants.
\q
\v 92 Unless thy law had been my comfort, I would have died in my misery;
\q2
\v 93 never shall I forget thy laws, for they put new life into me.
\q
\v 94 Help me, for I am thine, I study thy behests;
\q2
\v 95 the ungodly lie in wait to kill me, but I pay close heed to thine orders.
\q2
\v 96 I see a limit to all things, but thy law has a mighty range.
\b
\q
\v 97 Oh how I love thy law! I muse upon it all day long;
\q2
\v 98 thy commands make me wiser than my foes; I am never without them.
\q
\v 99 I have more insight than all these oracles, for I muse on thine injunctions!
\q2
\v 100 I know more than these sages, for I carry out thy behests!
\q
\v 101 I avoid all evil courses, that I may do thy bidding;
\q2
\v 102 thou art my teacher, never do I swerve from thine instructions.
\q
\v 103 How sweet thy sayings are, sweeter than honey to the taste!
\q2
\v 104 I learn sense from thy behests, learn to hate godless ways.
\b
\q
\v 105 Thy law is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path;
\q2
\v 106 I swore to follow thy just decrees, and I will do it;
\q2
\v 107 revive me as thou hast promised, O Eternal, in my great misery.
\q
\v 108 Accept the vows I breathe to thee, and teach me thy decrees;
\q2
\v 109 my life is ever in danger, but I never forget thy law;
\q2
\v 110 ungodly men set snares for me, but I never give up thine orders.
\q
\v 111 I have a lasting heritage in thy commands, thy are my heart’s delight;
\q2
\v 112 I set myself to execute thine orders ever, at every step.
\b
\q
\v 113 I hate men who are half and half, I love thy law;
\q2
\v 114 I await thy promise, thou my shield and shelter.
\q2 Begone, you villains, let me keep my God’s commands!
\q
\v 116 Uphold me, as thou hast promised, disappoint not my hope, but let me live;
\q2
\v 117 hold me up safe, let me delight for ever in thy will.
\q
\v 118 Thou spurnest all who swerve from thy will, their notions end in nothing.
\q2
\v 119 I count all the ungodly so much dross; I love thy rule and order;
\q2
\v 120 my being shudders before thee, in awe of thy judgments.
\b
\q
\v 121 Leave me not to be oppressed, for I have done right and justice;
\q2
\v 122 pledge thy word to help me, let not the arrogant oppress me;
\q2
\v 123 I pine with looking for thy rescue, for thy saving promise.
\q
\v 124 Deal in kindness with thy servant, teach thy laws to me;
\q2
\v 125 instruct thy servant, let me understand thine orders.
\q
\v 126 High time for thee to act! – men break thy law;
\q2
\v 127 but I love thy commands above all things, above solid gold;
\q2
\v 128 I order all my life by thy behests, I hate all godless ways.
\b
\q
\v 129 Thy laws are a wondrous mystery – my soul obeys them – 
\q2
\v 130 the interpretation of thy words enlightens and instructs the open-minded;
\q2
\v 131 and I am open, eager, panting for thy commands.
\q
\v 132 Turn to me and have pity – it is due to those who love thee;
\q2
\v 133 direct my steps as thou hast promised, free from evil influence;
\q2
\v 134 deliver me from man’s oppression, that I may do thy behests.
\q
\v 135 Smile on thy servant, teach thy laws to me;
\q
\v 136 when men are disobedient to thy law, mine eyes stream with tears.
\b
\q
\v 137 O thou Eternal, thou art just, thy sentences are true;
\q2
\v 138 the rules thou has enjoined are just and absolutely sure.
\q
\v 139 Zeal carries me away, when my foes forget thy laws;
\q2
\v 140 thy promises are tried and true, thy servant loves them;
\q
\v 141 I am weak and despised, but I never forget thy behests.
\q
\v 142 Thy justice is eternal justice, and thy law is truth itself;
\q2
\v 143 trouble and anguish seize me, but thy commands are my comfort;
\q2
\v 144 thy laws are ever just; let me know them and so live.
\b
\q
\v 145 Answer me as I cry with all my heart, for I would obey thine orders;
\q2
\v 146 I call to thee, O Eternal, help me, and I will do thy bidding.
\q
\v 147 I am up before the dawn to pray, waiting for thy promises;
\q2
\v 148 I waken through the night to muse upon thy word;
\q2
\v 149 oh listen – thou art kind; revive me – thou art just.
\q
\v 150 My pursuers draw near in malice, far away from thy law;
\q2
\v 151 but, O Eternal, thou art near, all thy commands are true;
\q2
\v 152 I have long seen that thy decrees are valid for all time.
\b
\q
\v 153 Look at what I suffer, save me, for I never forget thy law;
\q2
\v 154 take my part, avenge, revive me as thou hast promised.
\q
\v 155 The ungodly are far from help, for they have no mind to thy laws;
\q2
\v 156 O Eternal, rich in pity, revive me – thou art just;
\q2
\v 157 I never swerve from thy control, though many persecute and press me.
\q
\v 158 I loathe apostates when I see how they disobey thy law;
\q2
\v 159 look at my own love for thy law, and in thy love revive me;
\q2
\v 160 the sum of thy commands is truth, and all thy just commands are ever binding.
\b
\q
\v 161 Nobles persecute me wantonly, but my heart stands in awe of thy commands.
\q2
\v 162 I delight in thy promise, as in ample spoil;
\q2
\v 163 ungodliness I hate and I abhor, but I do love thy law.
\q
\v 164 Seven times a day I praise thee for the justice of thy rule;
\q2
\v 165 right well they fare who love thy law; their road is clear.
\q
\v 166 I do thy bidding, O Eternal, and I hope for thy deliverance;
\q2
\v 167 my soul obeys thy laws, I love them dearly;
\q2
\v 168 I obey thy laws and thy behests, I live all my life under thine eye.
\b
\q
\v 169 Let my cry come before thee, O Eternal, and enlighten me as thou hast promised;
\q2
\v 170 let my entreaty reach thee, and relieve me as thou hast promised.
\q
\v 171 Let my lips praise thee for teaching me thine orders;
\q2
\v 172 let me sing of thy word, for just are all thy commands;
\q2
\v 173 let thy hand come to my help, for I have chosen to obey thee.
\q
\v 174 I am longing for thy help, O thou Eternal, and thy law is my delight;
\q2
\v 175 let me live that I may praise thee, help me by thy judgments;
\q2
\v 176 seek out thy servant in his wanderings, for I forget not thy commands.

\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 I cried to the Eternal in my woe – and the Eternal answered me–
\q
\v 2 “Save me from lying lips and crafty tongues!”
\q
\v 3 What will you get from Him, O crafty tongue, what punishment in full?
\q
\v 4 Sharp arrows poured on you, and burning coals!
\q
\v 5 Alas, I have to dwell in Meshek!
\q Alas, I have to live in Kedar’s tents!
\q
\v 6 Too long have I been living where men hate peace;
\q
\v 7 however peaceably I talk, they are for war.

\c 121
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 I life mine eyes to the mountains; ah, where is help to come from?
\q
\v 2 Help comes from the Eternal who made heaven and earth.
\b
\q
\v 3 Never will he let you slip; he who guards you never sleeps:
\q
\v 4 he who guards Israel will neither sleep nor slumber.
\b
\q
\v 5 The Eternal guards you, sheltering you upon the right;
\q
\v 6 the sun shall never hurt you in the day, nor the moon by night.
\b
\q
\v 7 The Eternal will guard you from all harm, he will preserve your life;
\q
\v 8 he will protect you as you come and go now and for evermore.

\d A pilgrim song, by David.
\q
\v 1 I am glad whenever they say to me, “We go to the Eternal’s house,”
\q
\v 2 glad when our feet stand at last inside Jerusalem–
\q
\v 3 Jerusalem that is now rebuilt, a city solid and unbroken.
\q
\v 4 Thither go the clans on pilgrimage, the Eternal’s clans,
\q
\v 5 to offer the Eternal praise, as he prescribed for Israel
\q [[there were the seats of justice, the royal tribunals of David]].
\b
\q
\v 6 Pray for the welfare of Jerusalem, “May all thy homes be safe,
\q
\v 7 may all go well within thy walls, within thy palaces!”
\q
\v 8 For the sake of my friends and fellows I pray, “May all be well with thee!”
\q
\v 9 for the sake of the house of our God the Eternal, I would have thee prosper.

\c 123
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 To thee I life mine eyes, enthroned in heaven.
\q
\v 2 As the eyes of servants are fixed on the hand of their lord,
\q and as a maid’s eyes on the hand of her mistress,
\q so our eyes look to our God, the Eternal, till he takes pity on us.
\q
\v 3 Take pity on us, O Eternal, oh take pity;
\q
\v 4 for we have had our fill, and more, of scorn and sneers,
\q from arrogant creatures at their ease.

\c 124
\d A pilgrim song, by David.
\q
\v 1 “Had not the Eternal been upon our side”–
\q
\v 2 “had not the Eternal been upon our side,
\q2 when men rose to attack us,
\q
\v 3 they would have swallowed us alive,
\q2 so fierce their anger flamed;
\q
\v 4 the floods would have swept us away,
\q2 the streams would have surged over us,
\q
\v 5 surging clean over us,
\q2 with proud, wild waves.
\q
\v 6 But, blessed be the Eternal!
\q2 he did not leave us for their teeth to tear;
\q
\v 7 we escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare,
\q2 the snare broke, we made our escape.
\q
\v 8 Our help lies in the Eternal,
\q2 who made heaven and earth!”

\c 125
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 Those who trust in the Eternal are like Sion hill, never to be shaken;
\q
\v 2 Jerusalem sites enthroned for ever, with the hills around her,
\q and the Eternal is around his people now and evermore.
\q
\v 3 He will not leave the land of the just under the sway of knaves;
\q or else just men themselves might take to evil.
\q
\v 4 O thou Eternal, be good to the good, to those who are upright in heart;
\q
\v 5 as for the shifty and disloyal – may the Eternal scatter them [[with evildoers, and Israel prosper]]!

\c 126
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 When the Eternal brought the exiles back to Sion,
\q2 we were like men who dreamed;
\q
\v 2 laughter filled our lips,
\q2 shouts of joy were on our tongues;
\q the very heathen said,
\q2 “The Eternal has done great things for them.”
\q
\v 3 Yes, he had done great things for us,
\q2 and we rejoiced at it.
\q
\v 4 O thou Eternal, bring back now the rest of our exiles,
\q2 to fill us up, like streams in the dry south.
\q
\v 5 Those who are sowing in tears
\q2 shall reap with shouts of joy;
\q
\v 6 sadly they bear seed to the field,
\q2 gladly they bear home the sheaves.

\c 127
\d A pilgrim song, by Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Unless the Eternal builds the house,
\q2 workmen build in vain;
\q unless the Eternal guards the town, sentries are on guard in vain.
\b
\q
\v 2 Vain is it to rise early for your work,
\q2 and keep at work so late,
\q gaining your bread with anxious toil!
\q2 God’s gifts come to his loved ones, as they sleep.
\b
\q
\v 3 Sons are a gift of the Eternal,
\q2 and children are a boon from him.
\q
\v 4 Strong sons born when one is young
\q2 are like arrows in an archer’s hand;
\q
\v 5 happy the man who has a quiver full of them,
\q2 he need not fear to face a hostile band.

\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 Happy is everyone who reveres the Eternal,
\q2 who lives his life!
\q
\v 2 You shall earn your daily bread,
\q2 you happy man and prosperous!
\q
\v 3 Your wife within your house
\q2 shall be like a fruitful vine;
\q your children, round your table,
\q2 like slips of olive evergreen.
\q
\v 4 Here is the blessing
\q2 for one who reveres the Eternal!
\q
\v 5 The Eternal will send you a blessing from Sion;
\q2 you shall see Jerusalem flourish all your days,
\q2 you shall live to see your children’s children.
\q2 [[May Israel prosper!]]

\q
\v 1 “Cruelly have they harried me from my youth”–
\q2 so let Israel say–
\q
\v 2 “cruelly have they harried me from my youth,
\q2 but they have never crushed me.
\q
\v 3 The ploughmen ploughed my back,
\q2 and long they drew their furrows;
\q
\v 4 but the Eternal, he is just,
\q2 he has cut down the ungodly.”
\b
\q
\v 5 May all who hate Sion be routed and shamed!
\q2
\v 6 let them fare like grass-blades on a roof,
\q2 that fade ere ever they flourish,
\q
\v 7 that fill no reaper’s arms,
\q2 that none shall gather as he binds the sheaves,
\q
\v 8 that move no passer-by to say,
\q2 “The blessing of the Eternal be upon you!
\q2 In the Eternal’s name we bless you!”

\c 130
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 Out of the depths I call to thee, O thou Eternal;
\q2 Lord, listen to my cry,
\q2 let thine ears heed my entreaty.
\q
\v 3 If thou didst keep strict tally of sins,
\q2 O Lord, who could live on?
\q
\v 4 But thou has pardon,
\q2 that thou mayest be worshipped.
\q
\v 5 So I wait in hope for the Eternal,
\q2 my soul waits hoping for his promise;
\q
\v 6 my soul looks for the Lord
\q2 more eagerly than watchmen for the dawn,
\q2 than watchmen for the dawn.
\q
\v 7 Put your hope in the Eternal, Israel,
\q2 for with the Eternal there is love,
\q2 there is a wealth of saving power;
\q
\v ’tis he who shall save Israel
\q2 from all their sins.

\d A pilgrim song, by David.
\q
\v 1 No haughty heart is mine, O thou Eternal,
\q2 no lofty looks are mine;
\q I never meddle with high schemes,
\q2 with matters far beyond me.
\q
\v 2 No, I have soothed and stilled my soul,
\q2 as a mother calms her weanèd child;
\q2 my soul is liked a weanèd child.
\b
\q
\v 3 O Israel, put your hope in the Eternal,
\q2 now and evermore.

\c 132
\d A pilgrim song.
\q
\v 1 For David’s sake, O thou Eternal, remember all his piety,
\q
\v 2 how he swore to the Eternal, vowing to the Mighty One of Jacob,
\q
\v 3 “I will not enter my house, I will not lie on my bed,
\q
\v 4 I will not close my eyes in sleep, I will not shut my eyelids,
\q
\v 5 till I find some residence for the Eternal, some dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
\b
\q
\v 6 We heard of the ark at Ephrathah, we found it in the woodland;
\q
\v 7 we went to where he dwelt, and at his footstool knelt:
\q
\v 8 “Ascend, Eternal, to thy resting-place, thou and thy mighty ark!–
\q
\v 9 thy priests in triumphant array, thy worshippers loudly rejoicing!
\q
\v 10 For the sake of thy servant David, reject not thine own king.”
\q
\v 11 The Eternal swore an oath to David, and he will not break his word:
\q “I will set one of your own sons upon your throne;
\q
\v 12 and if your sons will keep my compact and the laws I teach them, 
\q2 their sons shall also sit for ever on your throne.”
\b
\q
\v 13 For the Eternal has chosen Sion as the seat that he desires;
\q
\v 14 “Here is my resting-place,” he says, “the seat I choose for evermore;
\q
\v 15 I will enrich her food-supplies, and satisfy her poor with bread.
\q
\v 16 I will robe her priests in triumph, and make her worshippers shout for joy.
\q
\v 17 There will I make David’s dynasty flourish, and my chosen king shine prosperously;
\q
\v 18 his foes I shroud with dark disgrace, but his own crown shall sparkle.”

\v 8 ’Twas he who killed the first-born in Egypt,
\q2 both of man and beast,
\q
\v 9 who sent portents upon Egypt,
\q2 on the Pharaoh and all his servants;
\q
\v 10 many a nation he struck down,
\q2 and mighty kings he slew,
\q
\v 11 Sihon king of the Amorites,
\q2 Og the king of Bashan,
\q2 and all the powers of Canaan,
\q
\v 12 giving their land to Israel,
\q2 to his people to possess.
\b
\q
\v 13 Thy name, O thou Eternal, lives for ever,
\q2 thy fame from age to age;
\q
\v 14 the Eternal will right his people’s wrongs,

\q
\v 15 Pagan idols are mere gold and silver,

\v 1 By the streams of Babylon, there we sat
\q2 and wept at the thought of Sion!
\q
\v 2 There on the poplars we hung up our harps,
\q2
\v 3 when our tyrants asked for a song;
\q those who had harried us bade us be merry,
\q2 “Sing us a song of Sion,” they said.
\q
\v 4 But how can we sing the Eternal’s songs,
\q2 here, in a foreign land?
\q
\v 5 Jerusalem, if ever I forget thee,
\q2 withered be this my hand!
\q
\v 6 May my tongue cleave to my mouth,
\q2 if ever I think not of thee,
\q2 if ever I prize not Jerusalem above all joys!
\b
\q
\v 7 The Edomites! remember against them, Eternal,
\q2 that day of Jerusalem’s fall,
\q when “Down with her! down with her!” Edomites cried,
\q2 “Raze her to the ground!”
\q
\v 8 And you, Babylonians, you who plundered us,
\q2 a blessing on him who deals to you
\q2 all that you dealt to us!
\q
\v 9 A blessing on him who snatches your babes
\q2 and dashes them down on the rocks!

\d A song of David.
\q
\v 1 With all of my heart I thank thee,
\q2 I sing thy praise in face of all the gods,
\q2 for thou hast listened to my cry;
\q
\v 2 I bow before thy sacred shrine
\q2 to praise thee for thy love so true,
\q2 that far excels all ever known of thee;
\q
\v 3 the very day I call, thine answer comes
\q2 with courage to inspire my soul!
\b
\q
V 4 When kings on earth hear of thy mind and methods,
\q2 they shall all praise thee, O Eternal One,
\q2
\v 5 and sing thy providence;
\q for great is the Eternal’s sovereign might,
\q2
\v 6 he looks upon the lowly from his height,
\q2 and from afar he strikes the haughty down.
\b
\q
\v 7 Though I must pass through the thick of trouble, thou wilt preserve me;
\q2 thy hand shall fall upon my angry foes,
\q2 thy right hand rescues me.
\q
\v 8 The Eternal intervenes on my behalf:
\q2 Eternal One, thy kindness never fails,
\q2 thou wilt not drop the work thou hast begun.

\c 139
\d From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\q
\v 1 Thou searchest me, Eternal One, thou knowest me,
\q2
\v 2 thou knowest me sitting or rising,
\q2 my very thoughts thou readest from afar;
\q
\v 3 walking or resting, I am scanned by thee,
\q2 and all my life to thee lies open;
\q
\v 4 ere ever a word comes to my tongue,
\q2 O thou Eternal, ’tis well known to thee;
\q
\v 5 thou art on every side, behind me and before,
\q2 laying thy hand on me.
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
\q2 it is far, far beyond me.
\b
\q
\v 7 Where could I go from thy Spirit,
\q2 where could I flee from thy face?
\q
\v 8 I climb to heaven? – but thou art there;
\q2 I nestle in the nether-world? – and there thou art!
\q
\v 9 If I darted swift to the dawn,
\q2 to the verge of the ocean afar,
\q
\v 10 thy hand even there would fall on me,
\q2 thy right hand would reach me.
\q
\v 11 If I say “The dark will screen me,
\q2 the night will hide me in its curtains,”
\q
\v 12 yet darkness is not dark to thee,
\q2 the night is clear as daylight.
\q
\v 14 I praise thee for the awful wonder of my birth;
\q2 thy work is wonderful.
\q
\v 13 For thou didst form my being,
\q2 didst weave me in my mother’s womb.
\q
\v 14 Thou knowest all about my soul;
\q2
\v 15 my body was no mystery to thee,
\q as I was being moulded secretly
\q2 and put together in the world below;
\q
\v 16 all the days of my life were foreseen by thee,
\q2 set down within thy book;
\q ere ever they were shaped, they were assigned me,
\q2 ere ever one of them was mine.
\b
\q
\v 17 O God, what mysteries I find in thee!
\q2 How vast the number of thy purposes!
\q
\v 18 I try to count them? – they are more than the sand;
\q2 I wake from my reverie, and I am still lost in thee.
\q
\v 19 O God, that thou would’st slay the ungodly,
\q2 and bid bloodthirsty men begone from me!–
\q
\v 20 men who defy thee lawlessly,
\q2 rising against thee!
\q
\v 21 Shall I not hate all who hate thee, Eternal,
\q2 shall I not loathe these rebels?
\q
\v 22 I hate them with a perfect hatred,
\q2 I count them enemies to myself.
\b
\q
\v 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart,
\q2 test me and try my thoughts;
\q
\v 24 see if I am taking any course of wrong,
\q2 and lead me on the lines of life eternal.

\d From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\q
\v 1 From evil men deliver me, O Eternal,
\q2 save me from violent men,
\q
\v 2 from those who in their hearts plot evil,
\q2 all the time making mischief,
\q
\v 3 their tongue sharp as a snake,
\q2 with venom of vipers on their lips.
\q
\v 4 Preserve me, O Eternal, from the grip of the ungodly,
\q2 save me from outrageous men,
\q2 who plan to overthrow me,
\q
\v 5 from the arrogant who set a trap for me,
\q2 and spread their nets to catch me,
\q2 their snares beside my path.
\b
\q
\v 6 “Thou art my God,” I cry to the Eternal,
\q2 “oh listen to my plea.
\q
\v 7 Eternal One, my Lord, my saving strength,
\q2 who screenest me against attack,
\q
\v 8 let not ungodly men have their desires,
\q2 let not their plots succeed!”
\b
\q
\v 9 When they dare to beset me,
\q2 may their own intrigues overwhelm them!
\q
\v 10 God rain upon them burning coals!
\q2 God hurl them down, never to rise again!
\q
\v 11 Away with slanderers! may violent men
\q2 be hunted from one woe to another!

\q
\v 1 Eternal One, I call thee, hasten to me;

\q
\v 2 Let my prayer rise like incense before thee,
\q2 my lifted hands like the evening sacrifice.
\b
\q
\v 3 Set a watch upon my mouth, O thou Eternal,
\q2 guard thou the door of my lips;
\q
\v 4a may I have no mind to evil,
\q2 to take part in godless doings.
\b
\q
\v 5 When good men wound us and reprove us, ’tis a kindness;
\q2 I would pray ever to have their goodwill.
\q
\v 4b But as for evildoers, never would I taste their feasts,
\q2 never would I be their guest.
\b
\q
\v 6 [[They are given over to their tyrants,
\q2 to teach them that the Eternal’s threats are true;
\q
\v 7 Their bones lie scattered for the graves to swallow,
\q2 like stones splintered and crushed upon the road!]]
\b
\q
\v 8 O Lord, I turn mine eyes to thee;
\q2 let me not perish, I shelter with thee.
\q
\v 9 Save me from the snare they laid,
\q2 from evildoers and their trap;

\d An ode or prayer of David, when he was in the cave.
\q
\v 1 I cry aloud to the Eternal,
\q2 loudly I entreat him,
\q
\v 2 I pour out before him my plaint,
\q2 and tell him all my trouble
\q2
\v 3 when my spirits faint.
\b
\q They have laid a hidden snare for me
\q2 on the road I have to go;
\q
\v 4 I look to right and left,
\q2 but no man cares to know;
\q all help has failed me,
\q2 none cares for my life.
\b
\q But thou knowest my path,
\q2 Eternal One, I cry to thee;
\q
\v 5 I say, “Thou art my help,
\q2 I have thee, in the land of the living.
\q
\v 6 Oh listen to my cry,
\q2 for I am brought very low;
\b
\q save me from my pursuers,
\q2 they are too strong for me;
\q
\v 7 bring me from my prion,
\q2 that I may praise thee;
\q for good men are waiting
\q2 till thou deal kindly with me.

\c 143
\d A song of David.
\q
\v 1 O thou Eternal, hear my prayer,
\q2 listen to my entreaties,
\q2 as thou art faithful and true, oh answer me;
\q
\v 2 put not thy servant on his trial,
\q2 for before thee no living soul can be acquitted.
\b
\q
\v 3 The foe pursues me,
\q2 stamps me to the ground;
\q he forces me to dwell in darkness,
\q2 like those who have been dead for long.
\q
\v 4 And so my spirits faint,
\q2 my heart grows numb within me.
\q
\v 5 I remember the days of old,
\q2 I meditate on all that thou hast done,
\q2 I muse on what thy hands have wrought;
\q
\v 6 and I stretch my hands to thee,
\q2 my soul thirsts for thee like dry land;
\q
\v 7 make haste to answer me.
\b
\q O thou Eternal, my spirits are failing,
\q2 withhold not thy favour from me,
\q2 lest I become like a dying man.
\q
\v 8 Satisfy me with the dawn of thy love,
\q2 for in thee do I trust:
\q teach me what is the road to take,
\q2 for my heart is set on thee;
\q
\v 9 O thou Eternal, save me from my foes,
\q2 I flee to thee for refuge;
\q
\v 10 teach me to do thy will,
\q2 thou art my God;
\q guide me by thy good Spirit
\q2 on a straight road;
\q
\v O thou Eternal, as thou art thyself, revive me,
\q2 as thou art faithful, bring me out of trouble;
\q
\v 12 in love to me, wipe out my foes,
\q2 destroy all who harass me–

\b
\q
\v 5 Eternal One, come down upon the bending heavens,
\q2 touch the mountains till they smoke,
\q
\v 6 flash lightning out to scatter my foes,
\q2 shoot thine arrows to discomfit them;
\q
\v 7 reach from on high to raise me from these floods,
\q2 rescue me from these alien hordes,
\q
\v 8 with lies upon their lips,
\q2 with right hand raised in a false oath!
\b
\q
\v 9 O God, I would sing thee a new song,

\q
\v 10 O thou who makest kings victorious,

\q Save me from peril of the sword,

\v 11 rescue me from these alien hodres,

\v 13 May our barns be bursting with all sorts of produce,
\q may our sheep in the fields multiply in myriads!
\q
\v 14 May our rulers be strong, may nothing go wrong–
\q no raids or retreats, no panic in our streets!
\q
\v 15 Happy the nation that so fares!

\v 1 I will extol thee, my God, O King,

\q2 and praise thee for ever and ever.
\q
\v 3 Great is the Eternal, loudly to be praised,
\q2 his greatness is unsearchable.
\q
\v 4 One age shall praise thy doings to another,
\q2 and utter thy mighty acts,
\q
\v 5 dwelling on the glorious splendour of thy state,
\q2 and on thy marvellous doings;
\q
\v 6 they shall proclaim thine awful powers,
\q2 and tell thy mighty deeds;
\q
\v 7 they shall spread the fame of thy great goodness,
\q2 and sing songs of thy faithfulness.
\q
\v 8 The Eternal is gracious and pitiful,
\q2 slow to be angry, very kind;
\q
\v 9 the Eternal is good to all who look to him,
\q2 and his compassion covers all he has made.
\q
\v 10 All whom thou hast made shall praise thee, O Eternal,
\q2 thy faithful followers shall bless thee,
\q
\v 11 telling of thy glorious kingdom,
\q2 telling of thy might,
\q
\v 12 letting men hear of thy mighty acts,
\q2 of the glorious splendour of thy kingdom.
\q
\v 13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
\q2 and thy dominion lasts from age to age.
\b
\q The Eternal is true to all his promises,
\q2 and kind in all his dealings;
\q
\v 14 The Eternal holds up all who are falling,
\q2 and raises all who are bowed down.
\q
\v 15 All thy creatures look to thee,
\q2 for their food in season due;
\q
\v 16 and from thine open hand
\q2 they feast upon thy favour.
\q
\v 17 Faithful in all his dealings is the Eternal,
\q2 loving in all he does;
\q
\v 18 the Eternal is near all who call on him,
\q2 who call on him sincerely;
\q
\v 19 he satisfies his worshippers,
\q2 he hears their cry and helps them;
\q
\v 20 the Eternal preserves all who love him,

\q2 As long as I live, I will praise the Eternal,

\q2 mere mortals who can give no help;
\q
\v 4 when their breath goes they return to the dust,
\q2 and on that very day their projects perish.
\q
\v 5 Happy the man whose help is Jacob’s God,
\q2 whose hope lies in the Eternal One, his God,
\q
\v 6 maker of heaven and earth
\q2 and sea, and all they hold.
\q He remains ever true,

\v 7 he rights those who are wronged,
\q2 he feeds those who are hungry.

\v 9a the Eternal preserves poor foreigners,
\q2
\v 9b the widow and the orphan he relieves;
\q
\v 8c the Eternal loves those who are good,

\q2 and binds up their wounds.
\q
\v 4 He fixes the number of the stars,
\q2 and gives a name to each.
\q
\v 5 Great is our Lord, mighty in power,

\q
\v 8 who covers the sky with clouds,
\q2 provides rain for the earth,
\q till grass grows on the very hills,
\q2 and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind,
\q
\v 9 who gives wild animals their food,
\q2 that cry for it at eventide.
\q
\v 10 He cares not for the strength of the war-horse,
\q2 delights not in man’s armour;
\q
\v 11 the Eternal delights in those who revere him,
\q2 who trust to his own goodness.
\b
\q
\v 12 Praise the Eternal, O Jerusalem,
\q2 praise your God, O Sion;
\q
\v 13 for he has fortified your gateways,
\q2 and blessed your citizens within,
\q
\v 14 has made Peace guard your boundaries,
\q2 and filled you with the finest wheat.
\q
\v 15 He issues his commands to earth,
\q2 his orders run apace,
\q
\v 16 showering snow white as wool,
\q2 scattering hoarfrost thick as ashes,
\q2
\v 16 casting hailstones down like crumbs.
\q The waters freeze;
\q2
\v 17 he sends an order, and they melt;
\q once he makes the wind blow,
\q2 then the waters flow.
\q
\v 19 He makes his purpose known to Jacob,
\q2 his orders and his laws to Israel;
\q
\v 20 never has he done so to other nations–
